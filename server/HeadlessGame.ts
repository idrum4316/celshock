/**
 * server/HeadlessGame.ts — The authoritative simulation: a NullEngine scene,
 * the three systems that decide a round, and the wiring between them.
 * Owns: the engine/scene lifetime, the map, and the per-tick order. It is the
 * server's answer to `core/Game.ts` and follows that file's rules — systems
 * never import each other, every cross-system behaviour is a callback installed
 * here, and `ConquestSystem.update` runs BEFORE `BattleSystem.update` so a
 * bot's think tick sees this frame's flag ownership.
 * Invariants: NOTHING here may render, and nothing may reach a canvas — see
 * `server/README.md`. `GrenadeSystem` is here under `{ dust: false }`, which is
 * that rule applied rather than bent: where a grenade goes and who it hurts is
 * a rule and belongs to the authority, while `BlastDust` builds a
 * `DynamicTexture` and a `GPUParticleSystem` and neither exists without GL.
 *
 * A slot index IS a bot index, by construction: `Roster` lays its slots out
 * team 0 then team 1, `BattleSystem` builds its pool the same way, and both are
 * sized from `CONFIG.bots.perTeam`. That is what makes benching a bot for a
 * human a single array index rather than a mapping that can disagree.
 *
 * A person enters the world through the reinforcement pass in `step` and
 * nowhere else, and only once they have both waited out the clock and ASKED:
 * `Match` records the ask on `NetPlayer.deployRequest` and this class is what
 * spends it, against `ConquestSystem.deployAt` rather than against the index
 * itself. That pair is the whole of spawn selection on this side — see
 * `docs/multiplayer.md`.
