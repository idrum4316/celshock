/**
 * server/NetPlayer.ts — A connected human, as the simulation sees one.
 * Owns: the authoritative position, stance, health and team of one player. NOT
 * the position history a shot is rewound against — that is `LagComp`'s, which
 * records every `Hittable` the same way and so cannot drift between a bot and a
 * person.
 * Invariants: this is the ONLY record of where a player is that anything on the
 * server trusts. A client reports a position; `validate` decides whether this
 * object accepts it. Nothing here reads a client message directly.
 *
 * It is a `Combatant`, so `BattleSystem.acquire`, `hittablesAgainst` and
 * `ConquestSystem`'s occupancy count take it exactly as they take a `Bot` — a
 * bot cannot tell a person from another bot, and does not need to.
 *
 * There is no movement simulation here and that is the design, not an omission:
 * clients simulate their own `Player` and report the result, and the server's
 * job is to reject what is impossible rather than to recompute what is
 * ordinary. See `docs/multiplayer.md` for the trade that was taken and why
 * input replay was not.
