/**
 * server/world.ts — Rebuilds a map's SOLID world under a NullEngine, from the
 * baked collider set plus the layout.
 * Owns: the collider meshes the server's rays pick against, the terrain floor's
 * collider clones, and the nav/cover/obstacle structures built from them.
 * Invariants: this is the collider half of `MapBuilder.build` and nothing else
 * — no visuals, no materials, no textures, no AO bake, and the two merges here
 * (`strutMesh`, `clusterMesh`) merge COLLIDERS and draw nothing. It must produce
 * geometry that lines up with the client's exactly, or a shot that lands on a
 * wall here passes through it there.
 *
 * Why a rebuild and not a build: the server has no canvas, so
 * `DynamicTexture.getContext()` throws and `MapBuilder` cannot run at all (it
 * reaches one through `floorMaterial`). See `scripts/bake-collision.mjs`.
 *
 * Two sources, and the split is not arbitrary:
 *
 *   - **The boxes are baked**, because they come out of the structure builders
 *     and those build meshes and read textures. `MapBuilder.collider()` is the
 *     only place a collider is made and the `WorldBox` it records carries
 *     everything `CreateBox` needs, so the bake is lossless.
 *   - **Everything else is read from the layout**, because it is already data
 *     or already arithmetic: control points and spawns pass through
 *     `MapBuilder.build` untouched, and the floor is `TerrainField`. Baking
 *     those too would be three more things that can go stale for no gain.
 *
 * The four boundary boxes need no special handling — `collider()` made them,
 * so they are in the bake like everything else, and they keep the `w > 200 ||
 * d > 200` shape that `NavGrid`, `ObstacleField` and `CoverMap` identify the
 * boundary by.

 * `rayOnly` keeps it out of `SOLID_ONLY`, matching the client, so the movement
 * validator and everything else that asks where a body may be never sees a
