/**
 * server/wire.ts — Is a decoded client message actually shaped like the message
 * it claims to be?
 * Owns: the shape gate every inbound client message passes before any handler
 * on this server sees it, and nothing else. It owns no game rules — whether a
 * position is REACHABLE is `validate.ts`'s question and whether a spawn is
 * ALLOWED is conquest's; this asks only whether the fields are present and are
 * numbers.
 * Invariants: this is the only thing on the server that turns a frame into a
 * `ClientMessage`. Never let it touch a socket, a peer or a round — it is
 * called from two files and must stay a pure function of the bytes.
 *
 * **`decode` is not this check and never was.** It answers "is this JSON with a
 * string `t` on it" and then asserts the result to `ClientMessage`, so the
 * static type past that point is a claim about a well-behaved client rather
 * than a fact about the bytes — the same thing `cleanName`'s `typeof` guard
 * says about a name. Every field a handler reads off that message is a field a
 * socket chose, and there are two distinct ways that went wrong:
 *
 * - **A missing array took the process.** `onMove`, `onShot` and `onGrenade`
 *   each destructure a `Vec3` straight off the message (`const [x, y, z] =
 *   msg.pos`), and destructuring `undefined` THROWS — out of the socket's
 *   `message` listener, through ws's receiver, and out of the process, taking
 *   every other match in it down mid-round. `{"t":"move"}` is thirty bytes and
 *   needs nothing but a seat, and with `restart: unless-stopped` in front of it
 *   the result is a server that can be held down indefinitely by one client
 *   sending one message every few seconds. Reproduced on all three handlers.
 *
 * - **A non-numeric field walked through every check downstream.** Sending
 *   `pos: ["x","y","z"]` passes the whole of `validate.ts`, because each of its
 *   tests is a comparison and every comparison against `NaN` is false: speed,
 *   bounds, ground and solid all fall through, no `correct` is sent, and the
 *   server broadcasts the strings to all sixteen clients. It also bypasses the
 *   shot origin gate for the same reason — `Math.hypot(NaN, ...) >
 *   MAX_ORIGIN_SLIP` is false — so a client that has poisoned its own position
 *   can fire an accepted round from half a kilometre away. Confirmed against a
 *   live match.
 *
 * **The line is drawn at what can crash or poison arithmetic**, which is why
 * this file checks numbers and arrays and leaves the strings and the booleans
 * alone. Those already have doors and the doors are load-bearing: `cleanName`
 * bounds the one client string other people's screens render, `weaponSetup`
 * and the `MAPS` lookup resolve an id against a real table, and `crouching` /
 * `sprinting` are only ever read as the condition of a ternary, so no value a
 * socket can put in either reaches arithmetic. Duplicating those here would put
 * a second opinion beside a rule that already has one owner.
 *
 * A message that fails is dropped rather than logged, and the peer is not
 * punished for it. `Match`'s token bucket has already charged for the frame, so
 * a flood of malformed messages costs exactly what a flood of well-formed ones
 * does and is closed out by the same rule — while a log line per bad message
 * would hand any socket an unbounded write to the server's stdout.
