/**
 * server/index.ts — Process entry: the two HTTP endpoints, the WebSocket
 * listener, and the match registry.
 * Owns: accepting a socket, parsing the first message, routing the peer to a
 * `Match`, creating matches and bounding how many exist, and the liveness sweep
 * every socket in the process is pinged by. It owns no simulation and no game
 * rules — everything past the handshake belongs to `Match`.
 * Invariants: nothing here trusts a client. A socket that does not open with a
 * well-formed `join` at the right protocol version is closed, and a peer is
 * only ever given the slot the roster hands out. Never import a rendering
 * system; see `server/README.md` for what a NullEngine cannot do.
 *
 * **Everything an anonymous socket may spend is bounded here**, because this is
 * the only place one exists: a peer that has not said `join` holds no slot and
 * no match, so nothing downstream has a name for it or a place to charge it.
 * The four bounds are the payload size, the time it may stay anonymous, how
 * many sockets one address may hold, and — once it is past the handshake —
 * `Match`'s own per-peer message allowance. They are one subject rather than
 * four, and the reason is the process: Node is single-threaded, so a socket
 * that can make this thread work without limit is a socket that can stall every
 * match on the box, not just its own.
 *
 * **The pong deadline is the one rule here that is not one of those**, and it
 * is process-wide rather than split between this file and `Match` because a
 * dead connection is the same dead connection either side of the handshake.
 * See `PING_MS`.
 *
 * **This registry IS the lobby.** Matches live in this process's memory, so the
 * list it serves on `/matches` is authoritative for itself and needs nothing
 * central to check in with — which is true exactly as long as there is one
 * process. Two replicas behind one proxy would each serve their own half of the
 * world as though it were all of it, and a player picking `m1` would reach
 * whichever replica the proxy chose. See `docs/multiplayer.md`.

/**
 * The backstop under everything else, installed before anything can throw.
 *
 * **It is not a substitute for a single check and must never be treated as
 * one.** Every throw this catches is a bug with a real fix somewhere else —
 * the one that made it necessary was three handlers destructuring a `Vec3` off
 * an unvalidated client message, and the fix for that is `server/wire.ts`, not
 * this. What this answers is the second question: when the next one gets
 * through, how much does it cost?
 *
 * Without it, the answer is everything. Node's default for an uncaught
 * exception is to exit, and since 15.x an unhandled rejection is an uncaught
 * exception — so one bad frame from one socket, or one rejected promise in one
 * timer, takes down every match in this process and drops sixteen people per
 * match mid-round. `restart: unless-stopped` brings the container back in a
 * second, which turns a permanent outage into a repeatable one: a client
 * sending a single message every few seconds keeps the server down for as long
 * as it cares to.
 *
 * So the process stays up and says loudly what happened. This is the trade Node
 * warns about — resuming after an uncaught exception means carrying on from an
 * unknown state — and it is the right way round HERE, where the realistic
 * throw is inside one socket's handler or one match's timer and the rest of the
 * process is untouched. A match that has genuinely been corrupted has its own
 * way out: `rotate` abandons it and every client reconnects into a fresh one.
 *
 * The log line is the point, not the survival. A server that swallows these
 * silently is one where the next `wire.ts`-shaped bug is invisible until
 * somebody reads a stack trace they were never shown.
