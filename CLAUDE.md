# CLAUDE.md

The rules for AI coding agents (and contributors): what each thing owns, what is
load-bearing, and what must never be undone. `AGENTS.md` points here; `README.md`
is user-facing.

**This file is the spine, not the whole of it.** It carries the project's shape,
the wiring rule, the two rules the world layer cannot bend, and the conventions —
what crosses subsystems, or what a change anywhere could silently break. A
subsystem's own rules live in a companion under `docs/`, and each of those is the
**contract** for the code it names. The summary here is a pointer, not a
substitute: read the companion before changing that subsystem.

| contract | read it before |
| --- | --- |
| [`docs/weapons.md`](docs/weapons.md) | the viewmodel, the aim path, the two slots, an optic or a weapon model |
| [`docs/grenades.md`](docs/grenades.md) | anything about the one projectile in the game |
| [`docs/states.md`](docs/states.md) | a new screen, a new game state, anything about what a lid holds or lets run |
| [`docs/ui.md`](docs/ui.md) | any screen, any stylesheet, anything under `src/ui/` |
| [`docs/rendering.md`](docs/rendering.md) | lights, shadows, fog, outlines, the post chain, the sky |
| [`docs/world.md`](docs/world.md) | a map, a layout, a builder, the terrain or the rim |
| [`docs/editor.md`](docs/editor.md) | anything under `src/editor/` or the dev write endpoint |
| [`docs/bots.md`](docs/bots.md) | navigation, perception, cover, squads, bot cost |
| [`docs/deaths.md`](docs/deaths.md) | ragdolls, glass shards, Havok, the death cam |
| [`docs/pwa.md`](docs/pwa.md) | `public/`, `src/pwa/`, the service worker |
| [`docs/multiplayer.md`](docs/multiplayer.md) | anything under `server/` or `src/net/`, the roster, the collision bake, the regions, the two images and the proxy in front of them |
| [`docs/game.md`](docs/game.md) | extracting anything from `Game.ts`, `installMap`, what a frame owes |
| [`docs/build.md`](docs/build.md) | adding a generated asset, `vite.config.ts`, anything importing from `@babylonjs/*` |

Three more companions carry what is looked up rather than reasoned about:

- **`FILES.md`** — the module map, one line per file. Read it to find the right
  module.
- **`VERIFYING.md`** — headless-browser quirks and how to force each subsystem.
  Read it before writing a Playwright script.
- **`FINDINGS.md`** — the open-threads list: measured, worth doing, not yet done.
  Read it before performance work; delete an entry when you fix or disprove it.

**A section that outgrows the spine becomes a file of its own, and the rule is
mechanical so nobody has to weigh it.** When a `###` section here passes ~150
lines, split it into `docs/<topic>.md`: move the prose **verbatim** — this
material is argued rather than stated, and a paraphrase loses the argument along
with the reason the rule exists — demote its headings one level, and leave behind
a summary of a dozen lines carrying whatever a reader must not violate even if
they never open the file, plus the pointer and a row in the table above. Keep this
file under ~850 lines the same way. What must **not** move out is anything two
subsystems both depend on; that is what this file is for — and that clause is
what sets the number rather than any taste for short files. Four sections stay
long whatever their companion holds, because what is in them is what crosses
subsystems: the wiring, the two rules the world layer cannot bend (the collider
proxy and the metadata contract), and the conventions. They run to ~260 lines
between them. Everything else is held to the dozen, and the figure was ~600 while
there was one map and no netplay: it moved because the cross-subsystem surface
grew, not because the summaries were allowed to.

**Every source file has a contract header** stating what it owns, its invariants,
and what it must never do. Read it before editing that file.

## Project overview

**HOLLOWMERE — Cel-Shaded Conquest**: a browser-based, single-player
**first-person** Conquest shooter (8v8 vs bots, five control points, ticket
bleed). **Babylon.js** + **TypeScript**, bundled with **Vite**. ES modules, Node
18+, WebGL2 required.

**Zero audio files and zero model files** — every mesh is built from Babylon
primitives at runtime, all sound is synthesized WebAudio (`src/core/Sfx.ts`). Do
not add asset files unless explicitly asked. There are four exceptions, none of
them authored by hand and each with a generator in `package.json`: the icons,
Havok's `.wasm`, the water's two textures, and the photograph of each map the
menu stands on.

**Havok's `.wasm` (~2 MB) is the one binary that ships**, and it is never named
by path — Vite emits it content-hashed from the ESM glue's own
`import.meta.url`. Do **not** also hand-place a copy in `public/`: that ships
and precaches 2 MB twice.

**It is REQUIRED, and the boot screen is where that is enforced.** `main.ts`
awaits `loadHavok()` before it constructs `Game`, beside the WebGL2 probe and
with a failure message of its own; nothing downstream asks whether physics has
arrived, because there is no state in which it has not. Do not reintroduce a
fallback; if the engine is a problem, the answer is that the game does not
start. (What the optional version cost is in [`docs/deaths.md`](docs/deaths.md).)

**Never add a deep static import into `@babylonjs/core`, and never drop
`optimizeDeps.exclude` from `vite.config.ts`.** Both break a DEV session only,
both blame a subsystem that is not at fault, and both hide themselves on a
restart — the first silently unshaded the glow layer and every
`StandardMaterial` in the game, with nothing wrong in the renderer at all.

**There is no rigged character asset in the tree.** `GlbSoldier.ts`,
`entities/soldier/`, its `models/*.glb` and `@babylonjs/loaders` were deleted when
first person retired them, and the death cam deliberately does not bring them back
— it stands up a bot rig. Everything a character needs is procedural
(`SoldierModel.ts`). Do not reintroduce a GLB body, and do not extend that
approach to bots or weapons.

→ **[`docs/build.md`](docs/build.md)** — the four generated assets and the test a
fifth would have to pass, why the wasm's path is left to Vite, the dev-only 404
whose error message names the wrong thing twice, and the deep-import trap in
full.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit (strict, noUnusedLocals/Parameters)
npm run build      # typecheck + production build to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build
npm run icons      # regenerate public/icons (committed)
npm run shots      # re-photograph the maps for the menu backdrop (committed)
```

No test suite, no linter. `npm run typecheck` is the only automated gate — run it
after any change.

### Manual/automated verification

Playwright + Chromium are devDeps for ad-hoc browser smoke tests; write throwaway
scripts to the scratchpad, not the repo, and drive them through the
`window.__celshock` handle `Game`'s constructor exposes. **[`VERIFYING.md`](VERIFYING.md)
is the list of headless quirks** — the ~2 fps frame budget and what it invalidates,
how to force ADS / a grenade / a ragdoll / the death cam, and the sight-alignment
check every viewmodel or camera change owes. Read it before writing the script,
not after it misleads you.

## File tour

**[`FILES.md`](FILES.md)** is the module map — one line per file, stating what it
owns. The rules those modules obey are below, and in the `docs/` contract the
table at the top names for that subsystem.

## Architecture

### Ownership and wiring

`src/core/Game.ts` is the only place systems meet. Systems never import each
other; `Game` wires them with callbacks (`battle.onBotKill/onBotFired`,
`conquest.onCaptured/onNeutralised`, `player.onDamaged`, `deployScreen.onDeploy`)
and hands bot AI a `BattleCtx` (in `entities/Bot.ts`) built once rather than
rebuilt per frame. New cross-system behavior belongs in that wiring, not in an
import between systems. Type-only imports between systems are fine and common —
they are erased, so the runtime module graph still has no system→system edge.

**There is one system that calls another directly, and it is injected rather
than imported**: `BattleSystem` takes `CombatSystem` in its constructor (`Game`
still owns the wiring) and calls `combat.fire` for a bot's shot. A callback
would not do — the shot has to resolve synchronously inside the bot's think tick
so the result is available to the same frame's kill handling. Read the rule as
"never reach for another system", not "never mention its type".

**`Game.ts` is long on purpose**: most of its length *is* its job, and splitting
the wiring re-creates the system→system edges the rule above exists to prevent.
What may leave is a cluster of **private fields that answers only to itself** —
nothing else in the file reads them, and the methods over them touch no system,
no mesh and no frame (`net/RegionBook.ts` is the worked example). What may not
leave is anything whose methods reach across systems, however big it gets.

**`installMap` is the one place a map is built**, and both callers — a round
starting and an editor rebuild — go through it, because two copies of it drifted
apart once and the failure is silent rather than loud. **Anything new that
consumes a `GameMap` or an `EnvironmentSpec` goes in `installMap`.**

`Game`'s state machine is `menu -> loading -> deploy -> playing -> dying ->
deploy`, with `roundover` when a side runs out of tickets. The 3D scene renders
in **every** state, which is what lets the deploy screen and the menu sit over a
live view. `loading` (the map being built) and `dying` (the death cam) are
**STEPS, not lids**; `updateWorld` runs in full under the death cam and nothing
may simulate under the building card.

**A LID is a screen laid over a state, which taking it off puts back rather than
moving the game on — and which state is which, and what each one owes, is
DECLARED rather than described.** `SCREENS` in
[`src/core/ScreenStack.ts`](src/core/ScreenStack.ts) is a
`Record<GameState, ScreenSpec>` with one row per state, so **a new screen does
not compile until it has answered all four questions**: what it may cover,
whether the world under it is held offline, whether it owes the netplay frame the
authority keeps running behind it, and whether the scoreboard is owed to it.
`Game` has exactly three moves (`go`, `raiseLid`, `lowerLid`), **nothing in the
codebase assigns a game state** — `Game.state` is a getter — and `Game.takeDown`
is the one place that knows what putting a screen away means. **The question a
lid raises is never which screen is up, but whether what is under it is moving**:
offline a pause genuinely holds the world, and in a netplay round it holds
nothing, because the authority never heard the key.

`Game.updateGameplay` has a load-bearing order at the end of the frame: camera
update → carried-light updates → `lighting.update(dt, camera.position, mats)` →
`sfx.setListener()`. Light slot selection and audio panning key off the camera
position, so nothing may move the camera after them.

**Two things are pushed from `tick` instead, because they are owed by the states
that simulate nothing**: `mats.updateCamera()` (the shader's eye, or every
screen with a live view behind it is fogged against wherever the last live frame
stood) and `Game.pushScoreboard` (the Tab board belongs to the ROUND, not to the
states that simulate one).

`ConquestSystem.update` runs *before* `BattleSystem.update`, so a bot's think tick
sees this frame's flag ownership rather than last frame's.

→ **[`docs/game.md`](docs/game.md)** — the mechanical test for what may be
extracted from `Game.ts`, what `installMap` hands to which system, and the two
pushes from `tick` in full. **[`docs/states.md`](docs/states.md)** — the full
cycle, the four spec fields and what each replaced, the stranded-screen bug that
says why a step transition takes down the lids, pausing and the netplay inversion
of it, and the pointer-lock trigger.

### First person, the weapon on the camera, and the loadout

The camera sits **at `Player.eyePos`** — the same point `CONFIG.camera.eyeHeight`
defines and bots test LOS against — and there is **no player body mesh at all**.
Crouch is that one point moving, and `Player.center` must come down the same half
metre or the feature inverts and crouching makes you *easier* to kill.

**Three tables carry the kit and none of them knows about the others**:
`CONFIG.weapons` owns the round, `CONFIG.sights` owns the picture, and
`entities/finishes.ts` owns the paint, with `entities/weapons.ts` and
`entities/sights.ts` deriving their ids from the first two. **The finish table
decides nothing** and reaches neither the camera nor a caption nor the wire; no
scheme is offered on two guns, and that holds by CONSTRUCTION because a finish
names the weapon it belongs to. `standard` is the BUILT state, `takeFinish` is
taken before any optic, and **brass** has no key at all.

**What a weapon SOUNDS like is a field on it stating only what is DIFFERENT**:
`Sfx.shoot` owns the shape and `CONFIG.weapons[id].report` is eight scalars of
deviation from it, exactly as `recoilMult` scales `CONFIG.recoil`. **The rifle is
the reference and every one of its numbers is 1**, so a shooter with no weapon of
its own needs no default declared anywhere. The same two `action` fields voice
the RELOAD, and the player's own report is the one sound **exempt from the voice
cap**.

**Everything about an aimed weapon is arranged so that the reticle cannot lie.**
The aimed pose is DERIVED and never authored — `applyFit` cancels the fitted
sight's own `sightCenter` onto the axis `CombatSystem` sends bullets down — and
it owes a re-derivation on **every loadout change, including a change of
weapon**. So the hold sway is on the AIM and not the rendered camera, the kick
spring's off-axis terms are damped hard while aimed, and the reload breaks the
aim outright rather than posing an aimed weapon.

**Springs and timelines have one owner each**: the punch spring is `Player`'s,
the bob phase is `CameraSystem`'s, and the reload is a timeline keyed to
`Sfx.reload`'s clacks — change a fraction in one file and change it in the other.
A part moves only because a second merge let it out of the weapon. **The trigger
is two questions** (`semiAuto`, `burst`), and a reload, a swap, an empty magazine
or a death must ABANDON what a burst still owes.

→ **[`docs/weapons.md`](docs/weapons.md)** — the report's five layers, the crouch
latch, the gloss ladder, the viewmodel's rendering group and pose stack, the
reload's four beats, the kick spring's closed-form step, the recoil pattern's two
envelopes, the two slots, the five weapons, the head zone, eye relief, and the
procedural-model rules.

### Grenades

Everyone carries two and there is no resupply, so the pouch is refilled by death
and nothing else. **This is the only thing in the game that is not hitscan**: one
collision ray per grenade per frame, a pool that **refuses rather than stealing a
live slot** (both callers spend the grenade only after it has been accepted), and
a blast resolved against the **thrower's** target list fetched at detonation, so
friendly fire is excluded by construction exactly as in `CombatSystem.fire`. The
player's throw is a gesture with a release inside it, never a second trigger.

→ **[`docs/grenades.md`](docs/grenades.md)** — the bounce, resting and terrain
backstop rules, the GPU dust pool (the one place a particle system may be spawned
per event, and why `addColorGradient` would take the scene down), the throw
timeline, and the bots' range band.

### The interface is five screens and the chrome

`src/ui/` holds one class per thing on screen, and `HUD` is not where a new one
goes — it owns **only** the gameplay chrome. Each screen builds its own root and
appends it to `#hud`, so construction order matters exactly once: `HUD` writes
`#hud.innerHTML` and is built first. **A class on `#hud` belongs to whoever
raises it.** **One stylesheet per module that writes markup, imported by that
module**, and `index.html` gets no interface CSS beyond the black background and
the boot screen — nothing that reacts to game state may join them.

**A phone gets a sixth thing on `#hud`, and it is a DEVICE rather than a
screen.** `TouchControls` is polled by `InputManager` once a frame exactly as a
gamepad is, so nothing in gameplay has heard of it; it is drawn for `playing`
alone, and taking it away DROPS what it was holding.

**Every screen is a LIST, and a list whose rows can change under the cursor keeps
its place by IDENTITY rather than by index** (the lobby is the one that can).
**The way OUT is a button in its footer, never a row in its own list** —
`.ui-foot` / `.ui-back`, shared by all three list screens.

**They are drawn in ONE FRAME anchored to the VIEWPORT rather than centred in
it**: `.ui-screen` is a head, a foot and a body that is the LIST plus the PANEL
saying what the cursor is standing on, with the chrome running to the glass and
`--ui-max` capping the reading matter. **Everything is sized in `clamp()` over
`vmin`, and `--ov-scale` is a safety valve rather than the layout** — a scaled
screen is a miniature of a desktop layout, so the ladder stays 1 until the clamp
minimums no longer fit. **A screen over another SCREEN is opaque and a screen
over the SCENE is not** (`.ui-veil`, `.ui-solid`), and **the PAUSE is the one
card that does not take the screen**.

**The menu stands on a PHOTOGRAPH of the map, under the veil rather than in the
card.** `#menu-shot` is a root of its OWN at z-index 9: `showMenu` rewrites the
card on every map step and a re-inserted layer has no style to fade FROM, and a
child of `#overlay` would paint over the veil whatever its z-index. **A map with
no row in `src/ui/mapShots.ts` is not a broken screen.**

→ **[`docs/ui.md`](docs/ui.md)** — the shell and what it replaced, the four cards
as one class, the menu's rail and the map schematic drawn from a LAYOUT, the
backdrop's cross-fade and its one veil density, why **the pointer deploys only
through the Deploy button**, the deploy map, the kit turntable, the settings
panel, the lobby's row identity, the short-viewport scaling, and the touch
controls as a screen — with [`docs/pwa.md`](docs/pwa.md) for them as a phone.

### The scene has (almost) no Babylon lights

Cel materials carry their own light as uniforms — key, ambient, sky fill and a
packed array of up to `MAX_POINT_LIGHTS` (16) point lights — and `LightingSystem`
is the sole owner of dynamic light. **Adding a `PointLight` or `HemisphericLight`
to the scene will not affect any cel-shaded mesh.** The one exception is
`ShadowSystem`'s `DirectionalLight`, which no material reads: it defines the
shadow camera.

**Nothing drawn outside the cel shader gets fog for free, and everything that
draws outside it owes the same fade** from the one environment
`CelMaterialFactory.setEnvironment` publishes — the outline ink, the glow layer,
every unlit emissive material. Nothing may describe different weather from the
wall it hangs in front of.

**The world carries a VERTEX COLOUR buffer and its neutral values are the GL
defaults, not ours** — baked occlusion in the **alpha**, a world marker in the
**green**, the wind's sway weight in the **red**, because a mesh with no such
buffer reads the disabled attrib's `(0, 0, 0, 1)`: unoccluded, not world,
planted. That is what lets the rigs, the viewmodel and every effect mesh stay
correct while carrying nothing. The bake (`world/vertexShading.ts`) runs **after
every merge** and cannot be moved earlier: `VertexData.merge` throws when one
mesh in a group has `colors` and another does not.

**There is ONE wind and everything that leans in it leans the same way.**
`CONFIG.wind` is taken by `GrassShader` for the field and by the cel shader's
vertex stage for the world's foliage, clocked by `CelMaterialFactory.updateWind`
— advanced beside the field's rather than beside the shader's eye, because a
pause that holds the world must hold the canopy too. **Anything a collider stands
in for may never sway**, and **a swaying merge group draws its own ink** through
`MapBuilder.inkTwin`, because Babylon's outline hull has neither a clock nor a
weight and would hang a still ghost behind a moving leaf.

**The world is OPAQUE with exactly one exception, and it is glazing.** Glass you
can see THROUGH is `getGlass` (`#define CEL_GLASS`), a per-pixel Fresnel over a
cube `ReflectionSystem` bakes **one per GLAZED BLOCK** — not one for the map, not
one per material. Glass you cannot is `Build.pane({ backed })`, which composites
the mass behind it arithmetically and therefore writes DEPTH; that is 98% of
Coldharbour's glazing and the largest per-pixel saving on the map, and **it pays
only if the pane is drawn first**, which is why `Game`'s constructor sorts the
opaque queue FRONT TO BACK. **`backed` is a claim about the WORLD and nothing
throws when it is wrong** — the test is what a ROUND does. Everything else is a
flat opaque colour, and **no pane of either kind is outlined or a shadow
caster**.

→ **[`docs/rendering.md`](docs/rendering.md)** — the four light terms and the
three further rules the colour buffer carries, the ink's derived tint, the wind's
two bounds, the three light flavours and the muzzle-flash budget, the fog split
and `OutlineFog`'s cache rules, the shadow window and its four-tap lookup, the
reflection bake's seven load-bearing details, the capture zone's drawing, why the
dither is in the surface shaders, the constraints that look like bugs if you undo
them, and the painted sky.

### The map is data, not code

`src/world/hollowmere/layout.ts` is the entire level — placements, scatter
regions, control points, spawns, the water/grass/terrain rects — and `MapBuilder`
special-cases nothing, so **a second map is one new layout file plus an
`EnvironmentSpec`**. The `MapDef` pairing them also carries a `blurb`; every
figure beside it on the menu's map panel is read off the layout and the
environment, so nothing countable is stated twice. The two halves are paired in
`src/world/maps.ts`, which with `vite.config.ts`'s `WRITABLE` table and
`scripts/collision-hash.mjs`'s `MAPS` are the only existing files a new map
touches, and **nothing outside `maps.ts` may import a map's own modules**. A
`MapDef` must be a **module constant**, `Game.mapDef` may only be written from
the `menu` state, and **scatter placement is seeded — never call `Math.random()`
in world-building code**, or the nav graph differs between page loads.

**Four things that read like global constants are the MAP's**, each defaulting to
what the shipped valleys are, so a map that says nothing is unaffected:

| the map's | default | what a map that raises it owes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MapLayout.size` — how big it is | `CONFIG.map.size`, 240 | `terrain.size * terrain.cell` must equal it, and the rim's boundary boxes must stay over 200 m so the seven sites keying on `w > 200 \|\| d > 200` still can |
| `EnvironmentSpec.fogEnd` — how far you can see | `FOG_WALL` | it is pushed into `BattleSystem`, `NetRoster` and `RagdollSystem`; `audio.maxDistance` (70) and `bots.perception.engageRange` (55) did **not** move with it, so a clear map must be laid out knowing that |
| `MapLayout.surfaces` — how deep it stacks | `CONFIG.nav.maxSurfaces`, 3 | only a map that stacks FLOORS raises it; overflow drops candidates silently (see the bots section) |
| `EnvironmentSpec.lighting.shadowWindow` — how far its shadows reach | `CONFIG.graphics.shadows.frustumSize`, 110 | shadow length is `h / tan(elevation)`, and `shadowVisibility` returns FULLY LIT outside the window rather than fading — an undersized one draws a line across the ground rather than softening |

**The shipped maps are Hollowmere** (a night village), **Greyfen** (a jungle
valley two hours after sunrise) **and Coldharbour** (a city's business district
an hour before dusk). Greyfen is the map that pushed on how much SCATTER a map
may be; Coldharbour is the map the first three overrides exist for. The fourth is
stated by both, for the same reason: a sun came down.

→ **[`docs/world.md`](docs/world.md)** — the four overrides in full, the
heightfield and the road slabs cut against it, the winding trap that makes a
floor vanish, the builder and two-pass merge rules, the layout gotchas that have
already cost time, and the valley rim's contract with the sky.

### The map editor (dev only)

`F2` in a dev build opens `src/editor/`: free-fly the real scene, click to select,
drag gizmos, edit properties, sculpt terrain. Everything there is reached through
**one dynamic `import()` inside an `import.meta.env.DEV` branch** in
`Game.toggleEditor` — the *whole method body* is behind that gate, which is what
makes the chunk unreachable under `vite build`. **Never import `src/editor/`
statically.** Saving **patches `layout.ts`'s text and does not regenerate it**,
because that file is authored: an untouched entry is re-emitted byte for byte.
There is no undo; leaving the editor rebuilds from the layout module.

→ **[`docs/editor.md`](docs/editor.md)** — the two pointer modes and the terrain
brush, the three rebuild tiers and what earns each, `SelectionRef` and the three
files that must agree on a field key, the source-scan properties a save rests on,
and `environment.ts` patching.

### Visual meshes and collider proxies are separate things

The single most load-bearing rule in the world layer. Every ray test filters on
`metadata.solid === true` — `CombatSystem`'s hitscan (every shot),
`BattleSystem`'s LOS, `Player.probeGround`, the grenade's step ray, the death cam's
pull-in — and `moveWithCollisions` walks every mesh with `checkCollisions`. At
village scale, visual geometry must stay out of both.

| Kind         | visible | pickable | collides | `solid` | merged | frozen |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Visual**   | yes     | **no**   | **no**   | —       | yes    | yes    |
| **Collider** | **no**  | yes      | yes      | yes     | no     | yes    |

Colliders must line up with the surfaces they stand in for or bullet sparks land
off the visible geometry. `MapBuilder.collider()` is the only place that creates
them, and it also records a `WorldBox` for the nav grid — geometry added by any
other path is invisible to navigation.

**A collider answers two questions and they can disagree, which is why there are
two pick predicates and not one.** *Where may a body be?* is `SOLID_ONLY` —
`Player.probeGround`, the death cam's pull-in, the editor's centre-screen pick.
*What stops a round or a look?* is `OPAQUE_ONLY` — the hitscan and its wall cap,
the bots' and the aim assist's LOS, the grenade's step ray and its blast check.
Both live in [`src/world/solid.ts`](src/world/solid.ts) and both are module
constants, never minted at a call site. So a collider is one of three things,
and a builder picks which by how it declares the box:

| collider | body | round | in the nav/cover/AO boxes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ordinary — `wall`, `block` | yes | yes | yes |
| `porous` — a fence's coarse run | yes | **no** | yes |
| `rayOnly` — a fence's posts and rails (`strut`) | **no** | yes | **no** |
| `glass` — a breakable pane, intact | yes | **no** | nav only |
| `glass` — the same pane, broken | **no** | **no** | **no** |

**`porous` and `rayOnly` exist as a pair and describe one object between them**:
the coarse box is the fence a body walks into and the nav graph severs across,
and the struts are the timber a round stops on. A porous box is **not cover**
(`CoverMap` skips it, or bots hide behind something that stops nothing), and a
strut is invisible to navigation on purpose — a 0.1 m rail is a shape `NavGrid`
can only get wrong.

**`glass` is the one thing in the world that CHANGES, and it needs no new
predicate to do it.** A breakable pane is `porous` exactly, so both predicates
already get intact glass right, and breaking it clears `solid` itself — one
property write rather than a term every ray in the process evaluates.
`WorldBox.glass` exists only for the readers that must SKIP a pane rather than
merely pass a round through it: `CoverMap`, the AO bake, and the collision bake.

**Colliders are MERGED, because a pick costs per MESH long before it costs per
triangle.** `MapBuilder.struts` merges a placement's struts into one mesh (161
loose post-and-rail boxes cost *every* ray in the game ~17%); every BLOCKING
SCATTER collider is merged by LOCALITY instead (`MapBuilder.clusterColliders`),
one mesh per 12 m square over the whole scatter pass at once, because a scattered
field has no placement to merge by and the regions overlap. The boxes stay in
`colliderBoxes` one per prop, so nothing derived from geometry can tell; **only
plain `solid` boxes may be grouped**, and the grouping rides to the server as
`MapCollision.boxGroups`.

**A blocking scatter prop may not stand on a control point or a spawn**, and
`MapBuilder.keepClear` refuses it rather than the layout dodging by hand — a
flag inside a collider cannot be captured and sinks its own flow field.
Non-blocking props are exempt: a fern over a capture point is dressing.

**The floor is the one documented exception**, and it proves the rule rather than
bending it: the heightfield has no box that could stand in for it, so each block's
collider is an invisible *clone of the visual's vertex data* — same shape, two
separate meshes, only the clone marked `solid`. It emits no `WorldBox` and
`NavGrid` reads `TerrainField` directly. It is also the only `solid` mesh with
`checkCollisions = false`: `moveWithCollisions` is horizontal-only, vertical
placement is the ground probe's job, and bots never touch the collidable list.

### Mesh metadata is a contract

Six flags and one value, all read elsewhere; new geometry that omits them
misbehaves silently:

- `solid: true` — collider proxies only. Unmarked geometry is shot through, seen
  through, and walked through.
- `porous: true` — a `solid` collider that rounds, sightlines and grenades pass
  through anyway (`OPAQUE_ONLY` subtracts it; `SOLID_ONLY` keeps it). Declared as
  `BoxSpec.porous` by the builder, carried on the `WorldBox` and into the
  collision bake, and skipped by `CoverMap`. Today it is the fence's coarse run,
  and only that.
- `rayOnly: true` — the mirror: a `solid` collider that stops a round and a look
  but is no body at all (`SOLID_ONLY` subtracts it, `OPAQUE_ONLY` keeps it), and
  the one collider that emits **no `WorldBox`** — invisible to the nav grid, the
  cover bake, the obstacle field, the AO bake and scatter placement. Declared by
  `Build.strut`, merged per placement, baked in groups. Today it is fence posts
  and rails.
- `noOutline: true` — skipped by `addOutline()`. Every emissive part (eyes, flames,
  signs, reticle) needs it. Outlines are coloured ink (a darkened take on the mesh's
  own cel colour), thinned with distance per mesh by `updateOutlineScales()` and
  faded into the fog per pixel by `OutlineFog`. **How far it is darkened is the
  MAP's**, derived by `setEnvironment` from that map's ambient and sky fill: the
  ink is unlit and the surface under it is not, so a constant tint inverts into a
  bright halo wherever the light falls below it.
- `noGlow: true` — excluded from the `GlowLayer` in the `Game` constructor. Only
  meshes existing at construction time are scanned. A mesh that stays in bloom
  is faded with distance instead (`customEmissiveColorSelector`), and
  `infiniteDistance` is that fade's one exemption — it is what every sky mesh
  sets, and the moon is not in the valley to be fogged out of.
- `noShadowCaster: true` — excluded from `ShadowSystem.setCasters()`. Flat receivers
  (ground, roads) need it: casting from them is pure shadow acne.
- `surface: "ground"` — what a round that stops here kicks up. The odd one out:
  it is a **value with a default**, not a flag, and **absent means `"hard"`**.
  `MapBuilder` sets it on exactly one thing — the terrain floor's collider clone
  — so every wall, prop and roof in the village answers by omission and a new
  collider needs no thought at all. Read by `CombatSystem` to pick the impact's
  spark, its dust disc and its sound. Adding `"wood"`/`"metal"` is one member of
  `ImpactKind`, one row in that file's `IMPACTS` table, one arm in `Sfx.impact`
  and a `surface` argument on `collider()`; no signature in between moves.

### Bots: navigation, scaling, perception and squads

`NavGrid` is built from the finished collider set at map load, and its node is a
**surface** — a (cell, height) pair — not a cell. The cap is
`CONFIG.nav.maxSurfaces` (3) unless the map raises it, and overflow **fails
silently: the candidate that does not fit is DROPPED, in arrival order**, which
makes the order a BUILDER declares its colliders in part of the design — walked
surfaces first, cover next, roofs last. One flow field per objective is
precomputed and nothing is ever recomputed: **bots read `nav.steer()`, never run
their own pathfinding, and never use `moveWithCollisions`**. `ObstacleField` is
the sub-cell half, and its push-out is a preference, never a veto.

Three things carry the frame budget and undoing any costs ~10x draw calls or a
permanent hitch: the rig pool is built once and never disposed, a rig is nineteen
merged meshes, and AI is staggered round-robin at `CONFIG.bots.thinkRate`.
**Everything a bot notices without seeing it is ray-free by construction** — the
LOS budget is the one thing here that does not scale — cover is baked, never
probed, and skill is one scalar drawn **per squad** from a seeded generator.

**Cover is baked as three nested masks and a query answers with a KIND.** Each
height is a hit SPHERE's top and never an eye height (1.7 standing, 1.3 crouched,
0.9 for the soft mask that protects nothing), and crouch cover is also CLOSE
cover. **A bot's crouch is one decision re-made every frame and one eased blend
read by everything else**, and the eye and the hit sphere come down together or
the stance makes a body easier to kill.

**A team's bots tell each other two things, and both are CUES that may never
enter `BotMemory`** (`entities/SquadRadio.ts`, one board per team): a squad-only
contact CALL, which is deliberately not a destination, and a HAZARD mark where
the team's own bodies have been falling. Everything in `BotMemory` feeds
`hasCue`, so a cue in there is a SEARCH — and a squad that investigates every
sighting never arrives anywhere.

**A squad walks as a line, not a column.** `movement.spacing` (5 m) is the
formation and `bots.separation` (1.5 m) is de-penetration; both come out of one
pairwise pass, the wide one is owed only to your own side, and it carries the
anti-herding. Reinforcements are scattered by `spawnJitter`, and a cover anchor
is CLAIMED so a baked lookup cannot hand four bots the same corner.

→ **[`docs/bots.md`](docs/bots.md)** — surface and link rules, the acquisition
cone and target hysteresis, the ray tests that set the crouched height, the four
states that take the stance, the radio's two cues and the measurement behind
them, the three sources of herding, squad planning and postures, and the
yaw/bodyYaw split.

### Deaths, glass, and the one physics engine

A killed bot falls under **Havok**, the only physics engine in the tree; so does
the stand-in body the death cam stands up, and so do the shards a broken pane
throws. **Nothing under it feeds navigation, cover or hit detection** — a corpse
is not in `NavGrid`, not in `ObstacleField`, not in `hittablesAgainst`, and a
shard is not either. `scene.physicsEnabled` is **false and must stay false** (the
game renders in every state, so a scene-driven step would tumble corpses under
the pause card) and Havok never touches a rig node.

**The engine is required and there is no fallback.** A full pool **evicts the
oldest corpse** rather than refusing, which protects the death cam's body for
free. **One refusal is left: a death past the fog wall**, where the rig is not
drawn, so nothing the player can see is ever denied a fall.

**`PhysicsWorld` owns the engine and neither client owns any of it.** It is
INJECTED into `RagdollSystem` and `DebrisSystem` by `Game` — the
`BattleSystem`←`CombatSystem` precedent — and `Game` steps the engine and *then*
its two clients, never the other way round.

`dying` is a **step in the state machine, not a lid**: `updateWorld` runs in full
underneath the death cam, so the tickets bleed and your killer walks past while
you watch, and it costs no time — `enterDeploy` is opened with `respawnDelay`
minus what the shot already spent.

→ **[`docs/deaths.md`](docs/deaths.md)** — the boot gate and what the optional
version cost, the pool's three tiers, the quaternion leak that freezes a
respawned bot, the map's single static body, the fog-wall gate shared with the
LOD, the shard pool and its distance gate, and the death cam's camera hand-off.

### Breakable glass

**Glass BREAKS where there is enterable space behind it, and is decoration
everywhere else.** A sheet hung on a solid mass stops nothing, so shooting it out
changes nothing you can play with and costs the building its word; Coldharbour
draws 6,139 sheets and twenty-four of them break, all shopfront bays. The rule is
declared as `PaneSpec.breakable` and it carries the collider with it, so there is
one kind of pane rather than two — everything else is glazing `MapBuilder` draws
and no other part of the game has heard of: not in `GameMap.panes`, not bucketed
for the sweep, not in the collision bake, not nameable on the wire.

A pane breaks and never mends inside a round, and that monotonicity is what makes
the incremental nav-graph update safe rather than merely cheap: the graph only
ever GAINS links, so a route that was valid still is.

**A round has to pass THROUGH glass, so a pane can never be in `OPAQUE_ONLY` —
which means the hitscan's wall pick can never report one.** `CombatSystem.fire`
raises `onShotPath` with the segment the round actually flew and `GlassSystem`
answers it analytically, bucketed by map block, at ~1 µs a shot; the same code
runs on the authority, which gets its panes off the collision bake.

**A pane's index in `GameMap.panes` is its identity** — on both sides and on the
wire, exactly as an index into `colliderBoxes` is, with `npm run parity` proving
both processes still build the list in the same order. Breaking is the
authority's: a client predicts the VISUAL on its own shot and leaves the collider
standing until told. **And a pane is see-through, which is the one thing about
glass that is a FAIRNESS rule and not a look** — `OPAQUE_ONLY` already lets a
bot's sightline through a window, so a frontage the player cannot see through is
one the AI can shoot them through.

→ **[`docs/world.md`](docs/world.md)** for the builder's side and
**[`docs/multiplayer.md`](docs/multiplayer.md)** for the wire's.

### Conquest rules

`ConquestSystem` owns flags, the capture meter, tickets and bleed. The meter runs
-1..+1 and ownership flips only by crossing 0, so a flag must be neutralised
before it changes hands. Occupancy is counted from the combatant list `Game`
assembles each frame. The player's health regenerates after
`CONFIG.player.regenDelay`: with eight hostile bots and no medics, a pool that
never refills turns the round into a respawn queue.

**A round is SCORED as well as counted, and the score is not the kills.**
`ScoreBook` is one ledger per simulation — points, kills and deaths, one row per
roster SLOT — held by `Game` offline and by `HeadlessGame` on the authority, so
the two boards cannot drift. `ScoreBook.awardKill` is the one place the shape of
a payout is decided: a kill, a headshot on top of it, and — keyed on **the flag
the VICTIM was standing in, never the killer's own position** — an attack or a
defend bonus. Taking a flag pays every body of that side inside the ring, and
driving it neutral pays them on the way. So the top of the board is not the top
of the kill column, which is the point of having one.

**Two consequences reach outside the scoring.** `ConquestSystem.onCaptured` and
`onNeutralised` are the SIMULATION's callbacks on both sides, so anything that
takes the conquest callback directly (as `npm run simulate` did) silently turns
the capture awards off. And the offline board is indexed by slot rather than by
bot: the player holds a slot like everybody else.

**A capture zone is DRAWN, not just counted** (`CaptureZoneSystem`, plus
`HUD.setCapture`), and the one rule that reaches outside the drawing is that
**the ring is the boundary** — it is built at `ControlPointDef.radius`, which is
what `pointAt` tests, so the line on the floor is not an approximation of the
zone; it is the zone.

→ **[`docs/rendering.md`](docs/rendering.md)** for the ring's surface sampling,
the skirt revealed by proximity and the markers that fade themselves out, and
**[`docs/multiplayer.md`](docs/multiplayer.md)** for the score on the wire.

### The installable app

The build installs to a home screen and launches fullscreen, landscape and
offline. Four files carry it — `public/manifest.webmanifest`, `public/icons/`,
`src/pwa/register.ts` and `src/pwa/sw.js` — and nothing in the game knows any of
it exists. The three rules that are about the DEVICE rather than the game: a tap
arrives twice (the second time as a synthesized mouse event, disbelieved for
`CONFIG.touch.mouseGrace`), a mouse that has not MOVED is not a mouse being used
(a locked pointer reports one every frame), and the trigger's gate takes
`touchActive` as a third term beside the pointer lock and the pad.

**`public/` is the one place a URL is written by hand**, because a home screen
keeps the `start_url` it installed with. The service worker is a **template, not
a module**: never imported, never typechecked, substituted into `dist/sw.js` at
`writeBundle`. **The NAVIGATION is network-first and everything else is
cache-first** — every asset is content-hashed, so a cached one can never be the
wrong bytes, and `index.html` is the one unhashed file. And
**`registration.update()` in `register.ts` is the only thing that ever checks for
a new build**; it looks redundant beside `register()`, and deleting it puts the
game back to needing five to ten refreshes.

→ **[`docs/pwa.md`](docs/pwa.md)** — the version hash over names *and* contents,
the `no-cache` requirement, the two assumptions that made a deploy take five
launches, the two numbers bounding the shell request, and the phone-shaped
details (fullscreen on the document element, `--ov-scale`, why `#loadout` is
excluded from it).

### Multiplayer: the server is the authority, and a slot is a slot

A dedicated Node process runs the real simulation under Babylon's **NullEngine**
— bots, flags, tickets and damage — and clients render it. There is no host
client. A shooter's hitmarker is a **guess**: every target is rewound and
`CombatSystem.fire` runs again on the server, which is the only thing that deals
damage. **Movement and health regeneration are the only two things a client
predicts** — movement is validated on arrival for speed, ground and solids — and
everything else it still steps in a netplay round is DRESSING.

**The roster is sixteen slots, built once, never resized**, and every slot nobody
is sitting in is a bot: a human joining BENCHES the bot in their slot and leaving
un-benches it. **Benching is not killing** — joining and leaving must never
charge a team a reinforcement — the bench lives in `BattleSystem` as a
`Set<Bot>` and never as a flag on `Bot`, **every loop over `bots` there must skip
it**, and **a slot index IS a bot index**. On the client a bot and a remote human
are the same object (`NetSoldier`).

**Four things arrive from the authority and may only be written through their one
funnel**, because a client that decides any of them for itself is playing a
different game in the same window: the local player's **team**
(`Game.applyPlayerTeam` — balance seats the second person on team 1, so a
hardcoded 0 turns every mine/theirs question backwards at once), the match's
**map** (`Game.applyMatchMap`; `Game.setMap` is the *player* choosing and is
never written from the wire), a **body coming into the world** (an ASK — the
deploy screen sends `deploy` and the authority places it), and the
**scoreboard** (state on the wire, a line per slot).

**The server cannot run `MapBuilder`**: it has no canvas, so `DynamicTexture`
throws. It rebuilds the solid world from the generated
`src/world/<map>/collision.ts`, including each box's `porous` flag, so **`npm run
parity` should be run after anything touching the world layer**. `npm run build`
refuses a bake older than its layout, but that guard hashes the LAYOUT — a
collider flag changed in a builder needs `npm run collision` run by hand.

**A STANCE is state, and what travels is the authority's own blend**: the client
sends `crouching` as a boolean and `EntityState.crouch` carries the RESULT,
because a client easing it against the authority's would disagree by half a metre
for the whole quarter-second the stance takes. **Each sound cue comes from
whichever side actually knows**: `fire` and `reload` are events carrying the
WEAPON in that slot's hands, a footstep is DERIVED from the body being drawn, and
the crack of a round going past is ADDRESSED to the one player it happened to
rather than broadcast — it says somebody was nearly hit, which is the read a
wallhack wants.

**`decode` proves only that a frame is JSON with a `t` on it, so a
`ClientMessage` is a CLAIM and never a fact**: `server/wire.ts` is the one door
that makes it one, nothing else on the server may read a frame, and a new client
message type owes an arm in its switch.

**There is more than one match server, the CLIENT holds the list of them, and
none of them knows another exists.** A `Region` carries BOTH its urls, resolved
together, because browsing one server and joining another must not be
representable; **a match id is minted per process, so every region has an `m1`**,
and every row, join and identity is qualified by REGION as well as id. **Two
processes behind one hostname is forbidden.**

→ **[`docs/multiplayer.md`](docs/multiplayer.md)** — the authority model and what
it deliberately does not defend against, the roster and the bench, the deploy ask,
what a death owes on each side, the interpolation clock and the sign error that is
easy to make in it, the rewind and why `resolve` takes a callback, the per-slot
scoreboard, the flag occupancy that travels beside the meter, why the AUTHORITY
holds the ping stopwatch, the lobby and the regions' two headers, everything a
socket may spend, what `npm run parity` compares, what may never cross the wire,
and what is not built yet.

## Conventions

- **All tunables live in `src/config/`** (`CONFIG`, `as const`). No gameplay magic
  numbers elsewhere — art/geometry constants stay in their model file. It is one
  module per subsystem, composed into a single `CONFIG` by `config/index.ts`,
  which is the only file that imports the sections. **A new tunable goes in the
  section module it belongs to, never in `index.ts`** — that file is a spine and
  holds one import per module and nothing else. Several modules export two to
  four keys (`weapons.ts` is `weapons`/`combat`/`gunfeel`), which is fine: the
  rule is one MODULE per subsystem, not one key. `FOG_WALL` is alone in
  `config/fogWall.ts` because `config/bots.ts` reads it, and taking it from
  `index.ts` would be an import cycle.
- `CONFIG` is `as const`, so a field like `bots.engageRange` has a *literal* type.
  `let x = CONFIG.bots.engageRange` then reassigning it fails to compile — annotate
  `let x: number` instead.
- Smoothing is normally the frame-lerp idiom `Math.min(1, dt * rate)`. **Anything
  that moves where bullets go, or that a player will read as recoil, is stepped
  EXACTLY instead** — recoil decay uses true `Math.exp(-rate * dt)` because burst
  climb must not vary with frame rate, and the viewmodel's kick spring is stepped
  in closed form at a stiffness Euler cannot hold. The landing absorb next door
  is semi-implicit Euler and may stay that way. Frequency decides which you need.
- Recoil only partly springs back: `CONFIG.recoil.recoverFraction` (0.7) returns 70%
  and pushes 30% permanently into the player's own `pitch`/`yaw`, so a magazine held
  down genuinely walks off target. An explicit product decision — a fully-recovering
  version was rejected. **`CameraSystem.addFlinch` is the one aim kick that is
  100% springy and must stay that way**: a hit *taken* is not a choice the player
  made, so a permanent share would ratchet the view skyward over one exchange. It
  shares the recoil spring rather than owning one, for the reason the bob phase
  has a single integrator.
- **A string of shots has a SHAPE, and the shape is two envelopes over one
  counter.** `CONFIG.recoil.pattern` tapers the vertical toward `pitchSettled`
  and ramps the horizontal up from `yawStart` across `patternShots`, both keyed
  to `Player.stringShots`, so the kick's *direction* rotates as a string runs.
  The pair is tuned to leave the total walk alone (10.6 deg of climb and 2.4 of
  drift over the rifle's magazine), and **those two figures are derived —
  re-derive them rather than assuming they followed** whenever `pattern`,
  `pitchPerShot`, `yawPerShot` or `firstShotMult` moves.
- **The recoil vector is built in `Player.recoilKick`, never at the call site.**
  Every number in it is the weapon's or the body's, and the horizontal is drawn
  ONCE per shot into `Player.kickDrift` so the aim, the viewmodel's lean and the
  view punch are all the same round going the same way. `Game` wires the result
  to the camera and does no arithmetic on it.
- **A team's colour is WORN, not merely drawn.** `CONFIG.teams[].color` paints
  a soldier's pauldrons, bandolier and helmet band as well as the deploy map's
  markers, so it has to stay saturated enough to read at three pixels through
  fog — a dull tone is only dull on a screen, and is no marking at all on a
  body. `SoldierModel`'s `KITS` owns the rest, and the two sides are told apart
  three ways on purpose, each covering where the last fails: **hue** (the only
  one that survives a body three pixels wide), **accent** (that team colour,
  placed so some of it faces every direction), and **silhouette** (a helmet shape
  per side, which is what is left when there is no colour at all).
- **Every ROUND is hitscan** — player and bots share `CombatSystem.fire()`, which
  takes the shooter's target list (so friendly fire is excluded by construction rather
  than by a team check inside) and the shooter's own `range`, which bounds the wall pick
  and the near-miss sweep as well as the damage. Tracers, sparks and impact discs are
  pooled; add effects to a pool rather than allocating per shot. The grenade is the one
  deliberate exception.
- **Damage is a slope, not a number**, and `range` is only where the ray stops.
  `ShotOptions` carries a fall-off band resolved against the distance the impact
  point already cost, so every weapon (and the bots' one flat round) degrades
  with distance. Quote a weapon's time to kill as the CLOSE one or say which.
- **The head zone belongs to the player by CONSTRUCTION, not by a check.**
  `ShotOptions.headMult` turns it on and only `Player.shotOptions` sets it; at 1
  or absent the head sphere is never ray-tested at all. That gate is load-bearing
  rather than a difficulty knob — bots aim at `eyePos`, the very point the zone is
  centred on, so a head sphere their rounds could find would make every accurate
  bot shot a headshot. It is an *upgrade* to a body hit that already landed,
  never a candidate of its own, and fall-off applies first.
- TypeScript is strict with `noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters` — the typecheck
  fails on dead variables.
- `Bot` holds a small FSM and drives a joint rig built by `SoldierModel` (invisible
  root + `TransformNode` joints). Animation is procedural, so a new behavior means new
  FSM states, never new clips.
