 * so it stays trivial, and all the real logic lives in src/editor/serialize.ts
 * where the compiler does cover it.
 *
 * That guarantee used to rest on @types/node simply not being installed. It is
 * installed now, for `server/`, so the root tsconfig pins `"types": []`
 * instead: the browser compile still sees no Node globals, and the reason is
 * now written down rather than being a happy accident of the dependency list.
 * `server/tsconfig.json` opts back in. See `server/README.md`.
 *
 * The plugin is `apply: "serve"`, so it does not exist in a production build.

 * and must look like a heightfield; `environment.ts` is patched one key at a
 * time by the floor picker and must look like a spec.
