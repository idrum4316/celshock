# FILES.md

The module map, one line per file, stating what it owns. Split out of
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), which is still the source of truth — it and the
subsystem contracts under [`docs/`](docs/) that it points to carry the rules
these modules obey; this file is for finding your way to the right one.
