/**
 * Ridge.ts — The valley rim: the landform that closes the map's boundary.
 * Owns: the escarpment's shape, and nothing else. Returns VertexData segments;
 * MapBuilder makes the meshes, the same contract TerrainField states for the
 * floor.
 *
 * This file emits NO collider. The four boundary boxes MapBuilder builds are
 * unchanged and are what actually bounds play, which is why NavGrid, CoverMap,
 * ObstacleField, Minimap and DeployScreen still identify the boundary by
 * `w > 200 || d > 200` and nothing here has to know they exist. If the rim ever
 * gains colliders of its own, that heuristic is the first thing to break.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - **Nothing it emits is inside `±size/2`.** The band runs from the boundary
 *   OUTWARD, where there is no playable space at all, so the whole landform
 *   costs zero playable area. `assertOutsidePlay` checks it in dev.
 * - **The basal band is VERTICAL and flush with the collider plane.** Colliders
 *   must line up with the surfaces they stand in for — every ray test and every
 *   spark lands on the box at `±size/2` — and a face that battered outward from
 *   the floor would put visible rock most of a metre in front of it at chest
 *   height, so rounds would spark on air. The variation goes into that band's
 *   TOP EDGE, never its position. This is the one part of the profile that is
 *   not free to be pretty.
 * - **The crest is authored as an ANGLE from the map centre, never a height.**
 *   Sky.ts culls stars at dome row 0.46 (7.2 deg above the horizon) and cloud at
 *   0.47 (5.4 deg), and paints the dome flat `fogColor` below the horizon — so a
 *   crest that drops under that exposes a band of sky with nothing in it. A
 *   tangent clamped at `MIN_SLOPE` makes the invariant true by construction
 *   instead of by careful authoring, and it makes the corners rise higher than
 *   the sides for free, which is what a valley looks like where two ranges meet.
 *   The box this replaced subtended 9.46 deg; MIN_SLOPE sits just above it.
 * - **Babylon is LEFT-handed** — a front face is clockwise seen from the front.
 *   The rim is looked at from inside the ring it makes, so its visible faces
 *   point sideways and INWARD; TerrainField's `assertFacesUp` does not apply
 *   and `assertFacesInward` is this file's equivalent. Trust it over your own
 *   derivation of the winding; the failure is silent, and getting the sense of
 *   the check itself backwards is the easy mistake.
 * - **Its own seeded stream, NEVER MapBuilder's.** One stream serves the whole
 *   map build in authored order, so a single draw from it here would reroll
 *   every scatter region on the map — a visible change to the level, with no
 *   error and nothing in the diff to point at it.
 * - No non-uniform scaling: these meshes are outlined, and `renderOutline`
 *   extrudes along normals `VertexData.transform` does not renormalise.
