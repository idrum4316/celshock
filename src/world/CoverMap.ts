 * and the queries over them.
 * Invariants: built ONCE at map load from the finished collider set and the
 * finished NavGrid; read-only and allocation-free thereafter. NEVER raycasts —
 * that is the entire point (see the class comment). Each cover height is a hit
 * SPHERE's top and never an eye height: cover that hides a bot from LOS but not
 * from bullets is worse than no cover at all — and for that same reason a
 * `porous` box is not baked as cover of any kind. The masks nest by
 * construction (hard implies crouch implies soft), which is what lets a query
 * answer with a KIND rather than a boolean. Soft cover is a hint about where to
 * walk and must never be treated as a safety claim.

/**
 * Cover, as an answer to one question: *if the threat is over there, does this
 * spot have something between us?*
 *
 * ## Why this is baked
 *
 * The obvious implementation is the one `Bot.pickDetourSide` already gestures
 * at — probe a few candidate spots at runtime and raycast to check. It works,
 * and it is the wrong shape here. Evaluating a handful of candidates per cover
 * decision, at 16 bots and `thinkRate` 5, is hundreds of extra `pickWithRay`
 * calls a second against an LOS budget that currently runs at a couple per
 * frame. And the answer never changes: the map is static, which is the same
 * reasoning that makes `NavGrid` bake seven flow fields at load and recompute
 * nothing.
 *
 * So cover is a lookup. The runtime cost of every query below is a bit test.
 *
 * ## Why a direction mask and not a visibility matrix
 *
 * A full cell-to-cell visibility bake over a 160x160 grid is 25,600^2 entries
 * and is not happening. But a bot does not need to know whether it can see a
 * specific cell — it needs to know whether the *bearing* the threat lies on is
 * blocked. Sixteen directions at 22.5 degrees each answer that in one byte,
 * which over the whole graph is 150 KB per mask against `NavGrid`'s own ~2.9 MB.
 *
 * The cost of that compression is honest and worth stating: bearings quantise
 * to 22.5 degrees (about +/-3.9 m of lateral slop at 20 m), and the probe has a
 * fixed length, so cover only applies against threats *further away* than the
 * probe. Both failure modes are benign — the second one correctly refuses to
 * let a bot hide behind a wall from someone standing on the other side of it.
 *
 * ## Three masks, and why a query answers with a KIND
 *
 * `hard` is geometry tall enough to stop a round aimed at a standing body.
 * `crouch` is tall enough to stop one aimed at a ducked body — the same test
 * against the lower sphere the stance actually produces. `soft` is anything
 * above knee height.
 *
 * The three nest: `hardHeight` (1.7) > `crouchHeight` (1.15) > `softHeight`
 * (0.9), so anything hard is crouch cover too and anything crouch is soft. That
 * is what makes `kindAt` a two-bit test rather than three queries a caller has
 * to reconcile, and it is why the bake sets the shorter masks whenever it sets
 * a taller one.
 *
 * The distinction between the first two is a whole behaviour: hard cover is
 * somewhere a bot can stand and shoot from, and crouch cover is somewhere it
 * has to get DOWN behind and stand up out of to fire. A caller that treats them
 * alike puts a bot behind a waist-high wall in a standing pose and hands the
 * player a free head — which is exactly what the wrong height buys at the other
 * end of the scale (see `hardHeight`).
 *
 * Soft cover is still not protection of any kind. It exists *only* to bias
 * movement toward walls and away from open squares, and a bot behind something
 * between knee and crouch height is exactly as shootable as one standing in
 * the open, whatever it does with its knees. Treating soft cover as safety
 * would be a lie the geometry cannot tell.
 */

/**
 * Directions in the mask. Sixteen is the largest that still fits a `Uint16Array`
