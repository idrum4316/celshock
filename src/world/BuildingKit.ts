/**
 * BuildingKit.ts — Facade for the parametric structure builders. Re-exports
 * the shared types and the BUILDERS registry; the implementation lives in
 * kit/ (core.ts = Build accumulator + palette + contract, buildings.ts,
 * city.ts, manor.ts, structures.ts, terrain.ts).
 * Invariants: builders assemble AT THE ORIGIN, UNROTATED and NEVER set
 * metadata.solid, checkCollisions, or isPickable — MapBuilder owns the
 * visual/collider split. A builder may take a BuildCtx to read the world it is
 * about to land in (the road bends onto the ground), but still returns
 * origin-local geometry. Collider top faces must stay within
 * CONFIG.nav.stepHeight of adjacent ground; ramp colliders need rotX.
 * New builders: write them in the kit/ file they belong to, register here.
 * No Hollowmere special-casing.
