/**
 * Navigation for Hollowmere: a uniform grid of walkable surfaces plus one
 * precomputed flow field per objective.
 *
 * ## Why not steering
 *
 * The retired enemies steered straight at the player and pushed themselves out
 * of obstacle circles afterwards. That works in an empty box and fails
 * completely in a village — a bot would grind along a cottage wall forever
 * instead of walking round it. A grid gives real pathing, and precomputing a
 * field per goal means 16 bots share the same seven searches rather than each
 * running its own A*.
 *
 * ## Surfaces, not cells
 *
 * A cell can have more than one standable height: the creek floor and the
 * bridge deck above it, the barn floor and its hayloft. So the graph node is a
 * *surface* — a (cell, height) pair — discovered by rasterising every collider's
 * top face into the grid. Two surfaces are connected when they are
 * side-by-side and within `stepHeight` of each other, which is what makes ramps
 * traversable and walls not.
 *
 * The map never changes, so all of this is built once at load and then only
 * read.

  /**
   * Builds the surface graph, then flood-fills it from the valley floor to
   * decide what is actually reachable.
   *
   * The flood fill is what keeps bots off rooftops: a roof is a perfectly good
   * standable surface, but nothing adjacent to it is within a step, so it is
   * never reached and never becomes walkable.
   *
   * The `<= step` test below is also the map's slope limit, and terrain leans
   * on it: with cellSize 1.5 and stepHeight 0.6 a graded bank is walkable up to
   * a gradient of 0.4 (~22 deg) and severs itself above that. Nothing else
   * enforces it, which is why the editor validates a terrain rect's skirt
   * against the same ratio.
   *
   * ## Why blocked surfaces are decided FIRST
   *
   * A surface keeps one link per direction — the nearest neighbour within a
   * step — and a surface with no headroom can never be stood on, so letting
   * one win that slot spends the link on a dead end. That is not a rounding
   * error: it is what made every ramp on the map a coin toss.
   *
   * Walk one. The ground under a ramp is blocked for as long as the slab is
   * within `HEADROOM` of it, and the ramp's own top face is a *separate*
   * surface only once it stands more than `HEIGHT_EPS` (0.35 m) above that
   * ground — below which `addSurface` merges the two and the entry is free.
   * So there is a band, from 0.35 m up to the `step` (0.6 m) where the buried
   * ground drops out of range entirely, in which both surfaces are candidates
   * and the blocked one is nearer. At the barn's 0.35 gradient a 1.5 m cell
   * climbs 0.525 m, so whether a ramp's samples land in that band is decided
   * by where the grid's cell centres happen to fall against its foot — i.e. by
   * the placement's world position. The barn's loft ramp landed in it and the
   * hayloft was unreachable by every bot on the map; the boathouse's identical
   * ramp escaped only because the bog floor slopes away under it.
   *
   * Skipping blocked candidates cannot cost connectivity, because the flood
   * fill already refuses to traverse a blocked surface — the link was a dead
   * end either way. `clearBlocked` reads only `counts`/`heights`, so it is
   * free to run before the graph it now informs.

   * between two centres and leave the cells either side both standable and
   * linked. The flow field then points straight through the wall, and the bot
   * walks into it for the rest of the round: `ObstacleField` keeps its body out
   * of the stone but cannot change where the field says to go. This was already
   * true of the chapel's graveyard fence and got much louder once the village
   * grew walls everywhere.
   *
   * Testing the *segment between the two centres* fixes it without sealing
   * doorways the way blocking whole cells would: a 1.6 m cottage door still has
   * links running through the gap, while a 0.5 m wall cuts every link crossing
   * it.
   *
   * A box only counts as a barrier where it stands more than a step above both
   * ends of the link. Otherwise a bridge deck, a kerb or the terrace's own top
   * face would cut the links leading onto itself.
   *
   * ## Pitched boxes are asked the same question, not skipped
   *
   * That height test is evaluated from the box's top-face PLANE at the
   * crossing, which is what lets a pitched box through the same gate as an
   * upright one: a ramp's own slab is within a step of the surfaces at either
   * end of a link running up it, so it spares itself exactly as the terrace top
   * does, while its underside spares the ground beneath it by `HEADROOM`.
   *
   * This used to be `if (box.rotX !== 0) continue`, on the reasoning that ramps
   * are surfaces to walk up rather than barriers. True of a ramp and false of
   * everything else pitched — above all a stair's PARAPET, which is pitched
   * only because it rails a pitched flight, and which stands a metre over the
   * treads. The manor's grand stair was the worked example: the parapet severed
   * nothing, so the graph offered diagonal links straight THROUGH the handrail,
   * every flow field took that shortcut over the flight's own foot, and
   * `ObstacleField` — which reads the same box correctly — pushed each bot
   * back out, at exactly `bodyRadius` from the rail's face. `Bot`'s stuck
   * watchdog is the only reason that was slow rather than fatal: it sidesteps
   * along whatever it is grinding on, which eventually walks the bot round to
   * the flight's foot. Measured on Greyfen, climbing from the great hall:
   * **9.7 s, four detours and ~3 s of grinding, against 4.6 s and none** with
   * the link cut. Cutting them costs no connectivity anywhere — the walkable
   * count and all seven fields' reach are identical on both maps.
