/**
 * MapBuilder.ts — Turns layout data into a GameMap: merges visual meshes per
 * material (frozen, unpickable) and then again per map block (BlockMerge —
 * neighbouring structures share a draw call), emits collider proxies,
 * registers fixture lights, builds NavGrid + CoverMap + ObstacleField.
 * Invariants: collider() is the ONLY place colliders are created — invisible,
 * pickable, checkCollisions, metadata.solid === true, never merged — and it
 * records the WorldBox for navigation. It sets no `metadata.surface`, and that
 * absence is meaningful: it is what makes every box read as "hard" to the
 * impact effects. The terrain floor's clone is the one collider that says
 * otherwise ("ground"). Geometry added by any other path is
 * invisible to rays AND bots. Colliders must line up with the visuals they
 * stand in for (sparks land on colliders). Visuals must never be pickable or
 * solid. Builders arrive at identity transform; merging then transforming is
 * what makes MergeMeshes safe. Must NOT special-case Hollowmere — a second map
 * is one new layout file, and build() takes the layout and environment as
 * arguments precisely so nothing here can reach for a named one.
 * Scatter runs off the layout's seeded RNG, never Math.random: blocking props
 * emit colliders, and colliders decide navigation.
 * The floor comes from a TerrainField, not a flat box, and every authored `y`
 * in the layout is an offset ABOVE it — so a building dropped into a basin
 * needs no bookkeeping. The floor mesh is the one place a visual and a
 * collider share vertices (an invisible clone per block); a heightfield has no
 * box to stand in for it, and splitting it per block is what keeps ray picks
 * rejecting it as cheaply as the old flat box did.
 * `build(..., { editor: true })` keeps geometry per layout item, tags it with
 * metadata.editorRef and indexes it — at the cost of the BlockMerge pass and
 * roughly 10x the draw calls. Authoring only; never measure frame cost there.

/**
 * Builds a map from the `MapLayout` and `EnvironmentSpec` it is handed — the
 * pair `world/maps.ts` keeps together. No map is named here.
 *
 * ## The visual / collider split
 *
 * Every ray test in the game runs against `metadata.solid === true` meshes:
 * `CameraSystem`'s occlusion pull-in (every frame), `CombatSystem`'s hitscan
 * (every shot), and the bots' line-of-sight checks. `Player.moveWithCollisions`
 * separately walks every mesh with `checkCollisions`. At village scale, letting
 * visual geometry carry those jobs means thousands of triangle-picked meshes in
 * the hot path.
 *
 * So the two roles are split, and nothing does both:
 *
 * - **Visual** meshes are merged per colour, unpickable, non-colliding, and
 *   frozen. They are only ever drawn.
 * - **Collider** proxies are invisible boxes, pickable, colliding, and tagged
 *   `solid`. They are only ever tested.
 *
 * Colliders must line up with the surfaces they stand in for, or bullet sparks
 * land off the visible geometry.
 *
 * Open-frame geometry is described TWICE rather than approximated once, which
 * is how it keeps that rule: a collider tagged `porous` is the solid world to a
 * BODY and not there at all to a ROUND, and the `rayOnly` colliders beside it
 * (`Build.strut`, merged by `struts()`) are the reverse — the timber a round
 * stops on, with no body behind it and no `WorldBox` at all. A fence is a 1.4 m
 * porous slab for walking into and nine merged posts and rails for shooting at.
 * See `BoxSpec.porous` / `BoxSpec.rayOnly`, and `solid.ts` for the two
 * predicates that split them.

   * Glazing is the one ALPHA-BLENDED thing in the world, and a transparent
   * mesh is sorted by distance and drawn on its own rather than batched — so
   * Coldharbour's six thousand sheets as a mesh each would be six thousand
   * unbatched draws against ~150 for the whole map. They merge per PLACEMENT
   * instead, exactly as `mergeByMaterial` merges a cottage's walls, and then
   * again per map block (`PaneBlocks`).
   *
   * **What survives both merges is the handful of panes that can be taken
   * away**, and they survive as a vertex RANGE rather than as a mesh: each
   * `breakable` pane's positions are a known span of the merged buffer, and
   * breaking one collapses that span onto its own first vertex. Every triangle
   * in it is then degenerate and rasterizes nothing, at a cost of one
   * `updateVerticesData` on one small buffer. That is why the second merge is
   * this file's own rather than `BlockMerge` — a block merge is what makes a
   * placement unrecoverable, and these ranges are carried through it by a
   * running vertex offset instead of being given up.
   *
   * What makes that collapse the whole of a break rather than the first half of
   * one is that a pane owns nothing else to take down with it. It casts no
   * shadow and carries no outline (see the `paneBlocks.finish` loop in `build`
   * for why glass has neither), so there is no second registration anywhere to
   * revoke — and `bakeVertexAo` writes the COLOUR buffer, so the bake is
   * untouched by a later position rewrite and may still run last.
   *
   * A breakable pane's collider is an ordinary `collider()` box, one mesh each,
   * which is affordable for the same reason the flag is rare: there is a room
   * behind twenty-four sheets on this map and behind none of the rest. Breaking one
   * is then two property writes rather than vertex surgery — see `GlassSystem`.
