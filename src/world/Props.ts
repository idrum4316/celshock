 * where a pine is a cone you see the whole of, this is a column with the
 * foliage held above the fight, so a stand of them closes the sky without
 * closing the sight lines under it.
 *
 * Three things about the shape are load-bearing rather than decorative:
 *
 * - **The lowest leaf hangs at ~9 m**, five times clear of the 1.7 m hit
 *   sphere. The collider is the trunk and its buttress core only (see
 *   `PROP_BODIES`), so anything at chest height would be foliage rounds pass
 *   straight through — the pine's rule, and a canopy tree has far more leaf to
 *   get it wrong with.
 * - **The buttresses stay inside 1.0 m of the axis**, which is the collider's
 *   own half-width, so the flare a player walks up to is the flare that stops
 *   them. They are what makes the trunk read as tropical at all; a bare
 *   cylinder of this height is a telegraph pole.
 * - **The fronds are two segments, not one**, and the outer one droops harder.
 *   A single straight blade reads as a plank at any distance the fog leaves
 *   visible; the break is where the whole silhouette comes from.
 * - **The shade is the PLATES' and the silhouette is the FRONDS'**, and the
 *   split is what makes a closed canopy affordable at all. See the crown
 *   below, which carries the measurement that forced it.
 *
 * **Some of them carry the belt's mid-story, and it is a CHILD of the trunk
 * rather than a prop placed near one.** `buildLianaVeil` is the curtain and
 * carries the argument for why the layer exists at all; what belongs here is
 * why it is built from inside a tree. A veil has to hang from a crown, and a
 * scattered prop cannot find one — `findSpot`'s burial test pushes anything
 * non-blocking out of a `blocking` tree's box, so a mid-story sampled as its
 * own region lands in the GAPS between the trunks, and neither the anchor's
 * height nor the tree's scale is known to the other. Hung here, all three
 * answer themselves: the veil is parented to the trunk, rides its scale, and
 * hangs at a fixed point on it.
 *
 * **`sub` is why that costs the map nothing, and it is load-bearing.** Every
 * draw the veil makes comes from a stream of its own, so the shared scatter
 * stream sees exactly the draws it saw before this existed and not one more —
 * which is what leaves all 354 trees, all 149 fern clumps and all five flag
 * walks on Greyfen where they already were. Drawing the veil from `rng` would
 * reroll the entire dressing field of any map with a jungle belt on it. It
 * defaults to `rng` so a one-off caller stays a two- or three-argument call;
 * `MapBuilder.scatterRegion` is what mints the real one.
 *
 * Nothing here is scaled non-uniformly — `renderOutline` extrudes along vertex
 * normals and `VertexData.transform` does not re-normalise them, so a squashed
 * part grows a lopsided ink shell.

 * belt is a floor, eight metres of clear air, and a ceiling. That gap is what
 * makes a stand of trunks read as columns in a park rather than as jungle: the

 * more trunks is a thicker plantation, and foliage brought DOWN to chest height
 * is the thing `buildFernClump` explains at length must never exist. Hanging
 * the layer from ABOVE is the one direction that is free.
 *
 * **It is part of the TREE and not a prop of its own, and that is the whole of
 * why it hangs off anything.** It shipped as a `lianaVeil` scatter region

 * belt puts a veil under a canopy. It does not, and the mechanism is the
 * opposite of incidental: `findSpot` rejects a spot buried in an existing
 * collider, a jungle tree is `blocking` with an 11.2 m box, and every tree
 * region builds before the veils — so the burial test pushed the mid-story into
 * the GAPS between the trunks by construction. Measured over the shipped
 * Greyfen: 179 veils, nearest trunk a median 4.62 m away against a canopy that
 * reaches 4.4 m, a hundred of them outside any canopy at all and thirty-nine
 * past six metres, hanging in open sky. No number could have fixed it, because
 * the anchor's height and the tree's scale were drawn independently and neither
 * knew the other. Hung from the crown there is nothing to keep in step: the
 * veil is a child of the trunk, rides its scale, and cannot be anywhere a tree
 * is not. See `buildJungleTree`, which is the only caller.
 *
 * **Nothing it draws is below 2.4 m, and that number is the whole safety
 * argument.** It clears the 1.7 m hit sphere by 0.7 m, so at any range worth
 * shooting across, a level sightline from a 1.55 m eye passes UNDER the hem —
 * the veil frames the shot instead of standing in it. That is what lets this be
 * non-blocking without repeating the fern's mistake: the fern rule is that
 * anything soft AT CHEST HEIGHT must be genuinely solid or genuinely absent,
 * and the way to obey it is to not be at chest height. So this carries no
 * collider, no `WorldBox` and nothing any ray in the game can find, which is
 * also why it can be hung at a density cover never could.
 *
 * The hem is DERIVED from that floor and the derivation now runs through the
 * TREE's scale rather than a scatter region's — see `drop` below. The tree is
 * the looser of the two (0.85 against the veil region's old 0.9) and the anchor
 * is a metre higher, which nets out as more rope: 6.4 m of fall against 5.6,
 * over a band that starts higher.
 *
 * **Where each strand starts is the CALLER's to say, and that is what makes the
 * layer worth having.** The obvious anchor is the bole, so anything within a
 * metre or so of the axis is under leaf from every angle. Built that way it is
 * genuinely attached and nearly useless: five strands inside a 2 m circle sit
 * within the trunk's own silhouette, so at the twenty metres a belt is read
 * across they thicken the column instead of filling the gap between columns,
 * and the eight metres of clear air the veil exists to close is still clear.
 * The blades of the lowest frond ring reach 3.9 m and the ring is already
 * built, so `buildJungleTree` hands over the blades it actually made and a
 * strand hangs UNDER one — out where the curtain is between the trunks rather
 * than on them, and under leaf rather than beside it. That is the whole reason
 * this takes `hangs` instead of picking a radius.
 *
 * The collar is the one part meant to be seen at the top — the woody mass a
 * liana gathers where it meets the bole, sitting half inside the crown so it
 * emerges from the foliage, with one strand of its own so it is visibly
 * holding something.
 *
 * The hem is deliberately uneven. Strands cut to one length read as a curtain
 * rail; the whole silhouette is in the raggedness, which is the same lesson
 * `buildJungleTree` states about its fronds needing two segments.
