/**
 * Greyfen: the same drowned valley, an hour or two after sunrise, with the sun
 * off the eastern rim and burning down through the canopy.
 *
 * ## The hour, which is what everything else here follows from
 *
 * This map shipped as an OVERCAST first light — a white lid of cloud, no disc,
 * no shafts, and a light budget of ambient 0.7 plus sky fill 0.3 against a key
 * of 1.12. Every one of those was internally consistent and the set of them was
 * wrong about the setting, in exactly the way Coldharbour's own file describes
 * from the other end: under a flat dome there is nothing for atmosphere to be
 * made OF, and there is nothing for a KEY light to be brighter than.
 *
 * Two symptoms, and they were the same cause:
 *
 * - **No shafts.** `discRadius: 0` suppresses the disc and, through the
 *   moon-direction contract `Sky` and `GodRays` share, the light shafts with
 *   it. A shaft broken by a canopy is the single most iconic jungle image there
 *   is, and this map already had the canopy to break it — five belts of
 *   hardwoods whose lowest frond hangs at 9 m with a mid-story of veils under
 *   that. The overcast premise was the only thing in the way.
 * - **Flat light.** Ambient and sky fill together put 0.62 of every up-facing
 *   albedo and 0.50 of every vertical one on screen before the key light was
 *   consulted, so a trunk's sunward face and its shaded face differed by 2.1x
 *   and the hardwoods came out as pale grey-green concrete. A jungle wants the
 *   opposite: a dark floor with bright gaps punched in it.
 *
 * So the ambient gives way (0.7 -> 0.24) and the key takes what it gave up
 * (1.12 -> 1.55). On the same bark that is 2.1x becoming 9x, which is the whole
 * of the second symptom. The FIRST is what the ambient buys as well as the
 * trunks: `sky.rays.threshold` is an occlusion test done in luminance with no
 * depth pass, so it only separates sky from world on a map whose world is
 * darker than its sky — see that field, where the bracket is measured.
 *
 * ## What did NOT move
 *
 * **`fogEnd` stays at 78.** `FOG_WALL` in `config/fogWall.ts` is the same
 * number as `bots.lodDisableDistance` and `bots.death.maxDistance`, and it is
 * also what `bots.perception.engageRange` (55) and `audio.maxDistance` (70)
 * were sized against. Coldharbour is the map that moved them, at the cost of a
 * layout built around the move; this valley is a fog that happens to be lit, so
 * none of them move. What the new hour wanted from depth it got from the light
 * instead of from distance.
 *
 * **`fogColor` stays green and stays bright.** Its own note below is still the
 * governing one — the haze is what a silhouette at 60 m is read against, and
 * the green is reconstructing a depth cue the geometry cannot give away. It is
 * also, now, the floor of the shaft threshold's bracket, which is a second
 * reason not to touch it.
 *
 * **`floorColor` stays dark.** The temptation on dropping the sun is to lift
 * the albedo back, and Coldharbour's file names it: the warm term in this frame
 * is the KEY, and warming the ground underneath it double-counts the hour.

  /**
   * Shaded leaf litter: a dark olive-brown, well down from the grey-green stone
   * this map started on and down again from the warm red-brown that replaced

   * back chalky on every up-facing surface once the ambient is raised too —
   * which is the ceiling a bright soil runs into, and why this one is dark for
   * a brown.
   *
   * **It was 0x4a3928, and what moved it was the grass rather than the soil.**
   * That value is authored in display space and then multiplied by the key, the
   * ambient and the sky fill all landing on one up-facing surface at once, so a
   * floor picked as loam in the swatch renders about 2.5x brighter and arrives
   * as bright tan — savannah earth, on a map whose whole argument is that it is
   * wet. It read as a floor with nothing on it, and every tuft the layout now
   * grows sat ON it as a bright green mark rather than IN it. What fixed the
   * undergrowth was not more undergrowth: at the density the layout can afford
   * (see its note — the field is already half of this map's triangles) the
   * tufts are always going to be discrete, so what decides whether they read as
   * ground cover or as scattered weeds is how far the gaps between them are
   * from the green. Dropping the floor closes that gap from both ends.
   *
   * **It did NOT come back up when the sun came out, and resisting that is the
   * point.** The ambient dropped by two thirds, so this albedo now returns
   * roughly a third of what it did in shade — which looks like a floor that
   * went too dark and is actually the feature: the dapple is only a dapple if
   * the ground between the gaps is dark. What carries the shaded floor instead
   * is that the gaps beside it are three times brighter, and what carries the
   * FAR floor is that it is fog well before it is anything else.
   *
   * It is also the only colour the surface below is painted in: every tone
   * `dirt` puts on the ground is derived from this, so re-tinting the valley

   * pale shape against dark. `fogStart` is pushed out because a bright fog
   * that begins too near flattens the middle distance into nothing.
   *
   * **It is GREEN, and that is doing a job the geometry cannot.** It was a
   * cold blue-grey, which is honest about what air is and wrong about what a
   * jungle looks like. What actually makes a rainforest read green at distance
   * is not the air — it is that every sight line past thirty metres passes
   * through several layers of leaf, so each plane arrives greener and hazier
   * than the last. This engine cannot give that away: fog is one flat colour
   * per pixel, resolved against distance, and the world beyond the near belt is
   * spaced trunks with sky between them. A neutral fog therefore washed every
   * far tree to white and threw away the one depth cue the setting owns. Tinting
   * the wall itself is the cheap reconstruction of it, and at this range it is
   * indistinguishable from the real thing.
   *
   * Held to a green-GREY. A saturated green here stops reading as distance and
   * starts reading as gas, and the luminance stays near what the blue-grey had

     *   frond 80 px off the sun took +0.03 at `intensity` 0.8, against +0.09 at
     *   this value, and the beams stopped reaching past the crown.
     *
     * So 0.42: a core that still reads as a disc, with enough lifted air around
     * it to be a source. Under Coldharbour's 0.6 because the halo here competes
     * with a fog wall at luma 0.737 rather than with a haze that starts at
     * 130 m — the sky's advantage over the world is smaller on this map, and
     * the halo is the term that would spend it.

    /**
     * The shafts' own two numbers. **The threshold is BRACKETED rather than
     * chosen, and both ends are measurable** — which is the only honest way to
     * set a number doing an occlusion test's whole job with no depth pass.
     *
     * The floor is the brightest non-sky pixel in the frame, and it is
     * MEASURED. Every distant surface asymptotes to `fogColor` at luma 0.737
     * and nothing in the diffuse world gets past it: the shader's soft shoulder
     * compresses anything over 0.75, the ground mist is a `mix` toward 0.787
     * that peaks at 0.28 of the way there, and the sunlit forest floor comes
     * back at 0.16-0.22 against 0.06-0.10 in the canopy's shade. Photographed
     * from inside belt 2 with the sun behind the camera, the whole frame peaks
     * at 0.795 and NOTHING crosses 0.82; over the flooded basin, masking every
     * pixel over the line puts all of them above the horizon and none in the
     * water, its foam or its flecks, which top out at 0.766.
     *
     * The ceiling is the dimmest sky the shafts can reach: `moonGlowColor` is
     * 0.902 and `cloudLitColor` 0.941, with the disc clamped at 1.0 above them.
     *
     * So 0.82 sits in a gap running 0.737 to 0.902, and it is deliberately
     * nearer the middle than the floor because the two things that can still
     * defeat it are added PAST the soft shoulder and are therefore unbounded by
     * it: the ground sheen (`groundSpec`, warmed and tightened below for
     * exactly this reason) and the water's glint, which is why `water.glint`
     * came DOWN when the sun came out rather than up.
     *
     * **`intensity` goes UP, 1.3 -> 2.0, and it is the one number in this file
     * that disagrees with Coldharbour** — which took the same term the other
     * way, to 0.5, on the argument that a lit sky is half the frame at 0.9 and
     * the night value returns a white wash. Both are right, because the number
     * is not a statement about how bright the sky is. It is a statement about
     * how much of that brightness the accumulation can actually REACH, and
     * three things take it away here:
     *
     * - **The source is small.** Coldharbour's sky over 0.82 is a whole
     *   quadrant of a 480 m view. Here it is the disc and what the halo lifts
     *   around it, because the rest of the sky is within 0.07 of the fog wall —
     *   the fog IS the light on this map, which is exactly what stops the rest
     *   of the sky being a source.
     * - **The canopy eats the walk.** `density` is 0.55, so a tap covers only
     *   part of the way to the sun, and under a belt most of that is trunk and
     *   frond. Measured from inside belt 2 at `intensity` 0.5: the frame mean
     *   moved 0.393 -> 0.398 and nothing was visible at all.
     * - **`decay` runs on blocked taps too.** `illum` falls 0.96 per sample
     *   whether or not that sample contributed, so a beam starting behind a
     *   crown arrives with a fraction of an open one's weight.
     *
     * At 2.0 a frond 80 px off the sun goes 0.148 -> 0.289, which is the fan
     * reading rather than a wash — it lands on foliage at a fifth of full
     * white, not on sky already clipped at 1.0. The wash Coldharbour warns
     * about happens to a frame whose bright half is reachable; under a canopy
     * it is not.
