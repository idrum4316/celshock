/**
 * "Is there a body's width of space here?", answered against the collider boxes
 * themselves rather than the nav grid.
 *
 * ## Why the nav grid isn't enough
 *
 * `NavGrid` samples one column per 1.5 m cell *centre*. A collider narrower than
 * a cell can sit entirely between two centres and leave every cell around it
 * walkable — and most of Hollowmere's props are exactly that: a scattered dead
 * tree or gravestone gets a 1.1 m collider, a fire drum 1.2 m. Flow fields then
 * route bots straight through the trunk. Even for the buildings the grid only
 * knows about walls that happen to cross a cell centre, so a bot can stand with
 * half its body inside a cottage wall.
 *
 * That is not just a visual glitch. `CombatSystem.fire` caps every shot at the
 * first `solid` hit and only counts a target sphere *closer* than that, so a bot
 * embedded in a prop has the prop soaking up every round aimed at it — the
 * "bots are stuck in things and impossible to shoot" pair is one bug.
 *
 * ## How
 *
 * Box footprints are bucketed once at load. A query pulls the handful of boxes
 * over one spot and pushes the body back out to `CONFIG.nav.bodyRadius` of any
 * face that is too tall to step onto and too low to duck under. Height is
 * evaluated from the top-face *plane* at the contact point, the same way
 * `NavGrid` does it, so a ramp reads as a floor at its foot rather than a wall.
 *
 * The map changes in exactly one way and in one direction: a pane of glass
 * breaks and never mends (`BoxSpec.glass`). So the buckets are built once, read
 * from then on, and only ever have entries TAKEN OUT — by `remove`, which is
 * the one writer and is called a handful of times in a round. Nothing here may
 * grow at runtime, and nothing may be added back.

   * The highest collider top face directly above `floor` and at or below

   *
   * **NOTHING CALLS THIS YET, AND THAT IS ON PURPOSE.** It is written and
   * measured against the ray it replaces, and it is one line from being switched
   * on; what it waits for is below, and FINDINGS 6 carries the numbers. Do not
   * delete it as dead code, and do not wire it up without reading that entry.
   *
   * THIS IS THE GROUND PROBE'S ANSWER, and it exists to retire a whole-scene
   * ray pick. `Player.probeGround` ran `scene.pickWithRay` with a `solid`
   * predicate on every frame: Babylon walked all ~1,800 meshes and ray-tested
   * all ~820 colliders to answer "what is under my feet", which measured as the
   * single largest piece of the game's own per-frame JS — five times the next
   * item, and scaling with how big the map is rather than with what is on
   * screen. The boxes were already bucketed here, and `NavGrid.rasterize` was
   * already computing exactly this at bake time from the same primitive.
   *
   * The band is closed at both ends because a floor is not the only thing above
   * a foot: `ceiling` is the probe's own origin (a step-height above the feet,
   * so a rise reads as a step rather than a wall) and `floor` is as far down as
   * the probe reaches. A roof overhead is outside the band and correctly
   * ignored.
   *
   * NOT the terrain. The heightfield has no box standing in for it — that is
   * the one documented exception to the visual/collider rule — so the caller
   * takes the higher of this and `TerrainField.surfaceAt`. And it is
   * `surfaceAt`, the floor as DRAWN, rather than `heightAt`, the smooth field
   * the floor is cut from: what the ray used to hit was a clone of the visual's
   * own vertices.
   *
   * ## What it is waiting on
   *
   * Over the nav graph's own walkable surfaces — the only honest domain, since
   * sweeping the map on a grid asks about positions a body cannot occupy and the
   * RAY is the one that lies there — this and `pickWithRay` agree on 99.8% of
   * 51k standable positions. The 116 that differ run both ways, and one class is
   * a blocker: along a fence line the analytic claims a surface half a metre up
   * that the ray passes straight through. That is the shared primitive rather
   * than this query. `topFaceAtLocalZ` extrapolates a box's top-face plane
   * across a footprint `halfDepth` INFLATES for anything pitched, so a tall thin
   * box tilted a few degrees claims ground beside itself. `NavGrid` lives with
   * that — a phantom node is a routing nuisance — and a ground probe cannot,
   * because it stands the player on air. **The fix is a footprint test bounded
   * by the box's real extent rather than its projected one**, and it belongs in
   * `boxGeometry`, where `NavGrid` gets it too.
