/**
 * Coldharbour: the business district of a city, an hour before dusk, with the
 * fighting in the streets.
 *
 * ## The fog, which is what this map is built around
 *
 * Both shipped valleys state `fogEnd: 78`, and Greyfen's file argues at length
 * that this is a design decision rather than an oversight: the fog wall was the
 * same number as the bot LOD, the ragdoll gate and the distance every other
 * budget was sized against, so "a daylight map that could see 200 m would need
 * every one of those moved together". This is that map, and they moved.
 *
 * What actually changed is that the distance is now the MAP's rather than the
 * config's: `Game.installMap` pushes `fogEnd` into `BattleSystem`, `NetRoster`
 * and `RagdollSystem`, which are the three that gated on `FOG_WALL`. So here a
 * body is drawn, posed and tumbled out to 480 m, and the fog wall as an idea is
 * gone — what is left is aerial perspective, which is a different thing doing a
 * different job.
 *
 * **`fogEnd` is therefore a GAMEPLAY contract wearing a palette field's
 * clothes, and it does not move for a look.** When this map's hour came down,
 * everything else in this file moved and that number did not: the extra depth a
 * low sun wants comes from `fogStart` alone.
 *
 * ## The hour, which is the rest of it
 *
 * This map shipped at three in the afternoon — a 58-degree sun, no disc, no
 * shafts, no particles, near-zero mist and not one outdoor light — and every
 * one of those was correct under that sun and wrong about the map. The file
 * used to argue each refusal separately. They were never separate: they were
 * all the same argument, which is that at a high neutral sun there is nothing
 * for atmosphere to be made OF. Ash reads as snow. Haze reads as smoke. A lamp
 * has nothing to do. Drop the sun and each of those inverts on its own.
 *
 * Three consequences worth knowing before tuning any of this:
 *
 * - **The shadow window is now this map's, and it is 200 m** (see
 *   `lighting.shadowWindow`). At 58 degrees a 40 m tower threw 25 m of shadow
 *   and the shipped 110 m window covered it; at 24 it throws 90 m and does not.
 *   `shadowVisibility` returns FULLY LIT outside the window rather than fading,
 *   so the failure is not a soft edge — it is a straight line across the ground
 *   where the shadows stop, sliding with the player.
 * - **There is a disc and there are shafts**, which is the reverse of what this
 *   file said for its whole life. `CONFIG.godRays`' luminance threshold IS the
 *   whole occlusion test and is calibrated against a night street, so it could
 *   not be used under a lit sky at any hour — the answer was to give the number
 *   to the map (`sky.rays`) rather than to give up the effect. See that field
 *   for how 0.82 is bracketed rather than chosen.
 * - **Sound and bot perception still did NOT move with the fog.**
 *   `audio.maxDistance` is 70 m and `bots.perception.engageRange` 55, so you
 *   can see far further than a bot will start shooting and further than you can
 *   hear one. That is deliberate and the LAYOUT is what makes it play: the
 *   avenues are broken by parked traffic, barriers and setbacks so that a clear
 *   line down one is ~110 m rather than the 320 the map is wide. This is the
 *   one of the three that the new hour leaves exactly as it was.
