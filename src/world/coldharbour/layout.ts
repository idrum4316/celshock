/**
 * COLDHARBOUR — the business district, mid-afternoon, with the fighting in the
 * streets.
 *
 * **320 x 320 m**, origin at the map centre, +Z is north. It is the first map
 * that is not 240: `MapLayout.size` states it and everything downstream takes
 * the extent as an argument, so nothing here is a special case. It is also the
 * first that stacks floors, which is what `surfaces: 4` at the bottom pays for
 * — see `MapLayout.surfaces` and the header of `world/kit/city.ts`.
 *
 * ## The plan
 *
 * Four avenues each way, 16 m wide, on centrelines at ±40 and ±120. That cuts
 * the map into a 5 x 5 of blocks: three bands of 64 m and, outside them, two of
 * 32 m against the boundary.

 *
 * The five flags are the centre block and the four blocks diagonally off it, so
 * every one is 113 m from C and 160 m from its neighbours, and the two home
 * yards are the far corner blocks — the NW and SE 32 m squares, left empty
 * because a spawn wants ground rather than a lobby.
 *
 * ## What each flag is, and why they are four different things
 *
 * - **C, the civic square.** A whole 64 m block of paving with the flag in the
 *   middle of it and a monument off to one side. It is the only objective on
 *   the map that is pure open ground, four streets feed it, and the towers
 *   round it overlook every metre — so it is the one you take last and lose
 *   first. What makes it crossable at all is the furniture: planters, a barrier
 *   run and two cars, laid on the diagonals a crossing actually uses.
 * - **A and E, the offices.** Three walked floors each, two entrances, a stair
 *   at one edge and a window band with chest-high cover round every upper
 *   storey. The flag stands on the GROUND floor, and the capture zone is a
 *   cylinder — so the storeys above it are inside the zone too, and holding one
 *   means holding a building rather than a circle.
 * - **B, the parkade.** The same trick with the roof off: three open decks, two
 *   ramps, and 0.95 m of upstand as the only cover. Every deck is inside the
 *   zone and every deck can shoot every other one, which no other objective in
 *   the game does.
 * - **D, the terminal forecourt.** Open ground under a long low hall, with
 *   planters and a tower for cover and no interior at all. It is the fast flag,
 *   and it is deliberately the one that plays like Hollowmere's square.
 *
 * ## The mixed-use stock, and what it is doing between the towers
 *
 * Eight `shophouse`s in four terraces and two `depot`s, all of them enterable,
 * and three of the towers gave up their plots for them. They are not near a
 * flag by accident and they are not on one either: each pair stands on the
 * block face BESIDE an objective — the two north of A, the two either side of
 * the terminal block, the two east of E, and the terrace and depot south of B —
 * so every flag but C now has a covered bound on its approach that somebody can
 * be holding. C stays open ground on purpose; it is the objective the whole
 * plan turns on being crossable and exposed.
 *
 * The second thing they do is the elevation. A block face of 26 m towers is one
 * building repeated, and a street reads at the scale of its FRONTAGES: a 13 m
 * shopfront with a blind over it and flats above puts a rhythm on the same
 * hundred metres that no arrangement of towers can. The storey count picks the
 * material (see `buildShophouse`), so a terrace written as a run of placements
 * comes out mixed without a layout naming a colour.
 *
 * **What they cost is colliders, and it is the number to check before adding a
 * ninth.** An enterable building is 35–50 boxes against a tower's 3, and these
 * ten took the map from 425 solid meshes to 783 — about +95% on every ray in
 * the game, measured. That is still under Hollowmere's shipped 863, and there
 * is not much room left; see `world/kit/city.ts`'s header, which owns the
 * budget.
 *
 * ## The sightlines, which are the thing this map exists to have
 *
 * An avenue runs the full 320 m and nothing breaks it. That is not an oversight
 * — with the fog wall gone (see `environment.ts`) it is the first map where a
 * weapon's own `range` is the binding constraint rather than the weather, and
 * those numbers are 45 m for the pistol, 70 for the SMG, 120 for the rifle and
 * 180 for the DMR. So a street here is a place where the DMR is finally worth
 * its recoil and everything else has to close. What the parked traffic, the
 * barrier runs and the planters do is break the line at CHEST height at
 * intervals, so closing one is a series of covered bounds rather than a walk.
 *
 * Bots are the other half of it: `bots.perception.engageRange` is 55 m and did
 * not move with the fog, so a bot will not open up down an avenue it can see
 * the whole length of. That is deliberate and it is what keeps the streets
 * crossable at all — the fight happens at the junctions, in the buildings and
 * on the square, and the long lanes belong to the player.
 *
 * ## Layout hygiene (keep to these)
 *
 * - Structures are axis-aligned (`rotY` in multiples of pi/2). The parked cars
 *   are the exception the editor already makes for a cart.
 * - Nothing but kerb furniture stands in a carriageway. A building that reaches
 *   into one seals a route the whole plan depends on.
 * - Scatter regions stay clear of the flags by their own radius plus the prop's
 *   half-length; see the note above `scatter`.

  // --- the street, as furnished ---------------------------------------------
  // All of this is one collider apiece and all of it is cover.
  //
  // **Every lamp carries a LENS and eight of the twenty carry a LIGHT**, and
  // the split is the sixteen-slot budget made concrete rather than a statement
  // about which lamps are switched on — a city's lamps come on together. A
  // lens is `Build.glow` and costs no slot; a light is one of sixteen,
  // uploaded nearest-first, and twenty of them out here would evict the
  // interior fixtures the lit buildings are legible by. So the eight are the
  // ones whose pool of light falls somewhere a player actually stands: the
  // square's own four, and the junction lamp nearest each of A, B, D and E.
  //
  // The eight are also the eight NEAREST THE MIDDLE, because the lamp grid's
  // inner ring is what happens to sit closest to the four diagonal flags — so
  // the worst case is a firefight on the civic square, where all eight can
  // contend at once. `LightingSystem` scores a fixture by `distance - range`
  // and does not cull by range at all, so the four junction lamps 47 m out
  // still take slots ahead of any interior further off; with up to four muzzle
  // flashes (`Game.spendMuzzleLightBudget`) and a grenade taken off the top,
  // that is thirteen of sixteen and three left for interiors nobody standing
  // on the square is inside of. That is the tightest this map gets, and it is
  // the reason the other twelve columns are lenses.
  //
  // This file used to say the lamps carry no light at all, and at three in the
  // afternoon that was right; see coldharbour/environment.ts on the hour.

  //
  // **Appended, never inserted, and that is a rule rather than a style.**
  // `findSpot` draws from the map's single seeded stream once per ATTEMPT, in
  // authored order, so a region added in the middle rerolls every region after
  // it — a diff nobody can read, and a nav graph that quietly moves. Anything
  // further added goes below this block.
  //
  // **The split between what blocks and what does not is the whole design.**
  // A blocking prop emits one collider apiece through `MapBuilder.collider()`,
  // and every solid mesh is on the bill for every ray in the game — the
  // hitscan, both LOS tests, the ground probe, the grenade step. A
  // non-blocking one emits NOTHING: no collider, no `WorldBox`, no nav cell,
  // no cover, nothing in the collision bake. So the ray budget buys cover and
  // the merge buys dressing, and the complaint this answers — that a downtown
  // looked swept — is about dressing.
  //
  // That is what lets the instance count go up by a factor of four while the
  // solid-mesh count moves by a couple of dozen. A literal density match with
  // the valleys would be ~750 instances over this map's open ground; that is
  // deliberately not the target, because a city's cover is its architecture
  // and a scatter field here is for what you fight AROUND rather than from.

/**
 * The five objectives.
 *
 * A, B and E stand INSIDE a building at ground-floor height, which is new and
 * is the point of them: capture is horizontal only, so the cylinder reaches
 * every storey above the flag and holding one means holding the whole
 * structure. `pos.y` is what the flag marker and the deploy map draw at and
 * what the capture ring is laid against, so it is the walked height of the
 * floor the flag is on rather than zero.
 *
 * Each of the three was checked against the builder's own geometry: none sits
 * in a service core, a stair lane or a car-park column, because a control point
 * inside a collider makes `surfaceAt` return -1 there and the flag becomes
 * uncapturable with nothing to see.
 *
 * **C is the fourth case, and it is that same rule with the monument standing
 * on the origin.** The statue is the square's focal point and the four paths
 * lead to it, so it wants the exact centre — and a flag at the exact centre is
 * then inside the shaft, which is precisely what `buildMonument` warns about
 * and what the editor's validator reports as "flag C centre is not standable".
 * Measured, not assumed: the monument at (0, 0) with C at the origin fails
 * that check and takes C's reachability from both homes down with it.
 *
 * So C stands ON the monument, at the top of its three steps — 3.5 m out from
 * the shaft, clear of the 2.4 m plinth, on a tier top that `buildMonument`
 * keeps at 0.34 m a step precisely so a body can walk up it from any bearing.
 * `pos.y` is that tier's height for the same reason A, B and E carry a storey
 * height.
 *
 * **The offset costs nothing, because it is along x = z.** The two homes are
 * at (-144, 144) and (144, -144), so every point with x = z is equidistant
 * from both — the same arithmetic the spawn list below spends a paragraph on.
 * Moving C 3.5 m along that line leaves both walks identical, which no other
 * bearing off the origin would have done.
 *
 * Capture is unaffected by the height: occupancy is a horizontal distance test
 * (`ConquestSystem.pointAt`), so the cylinder still covers the whole square
 * from the ground, and the ring is sampled per segment around its own
 * circumference rather than from the flag, so it lies on the lawn rather than
 * floating at plinth height.
