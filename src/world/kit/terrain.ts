 * (see CLAUDE.md); `boardDeck` in kit/manor.ts is the worked fix. Everything
 * else the boardwalk draws hangs BELOW this box, because a batten laid on top

/**
 * A plank causeway on piles: the connective tissue between stilt huts, and the

 *
 * ## Why this is not the trestle bridge with a height spinner
 *
 * The two have opposite navigation contracts, and it is geometry rather than a
 * parameter. A boardwalk's deck is under `stepHeight` above its own ground, so
 * it links along its whole length and needs no ramps; its underside is a
 * handspan off the ground, so `severLinks` cuts every link that crosses it and
 * `clearBlocked` blanks the ground beneath. It is a CAUSEWAY — you walk on it,
 * never under it, and that is correct. A trestle's deck is 1.6 m up: it links
 * only at its two ramped ends, and its underside clears `HEADROOM`, so the bed
 * stays walkable and you wade underneath. One builder with a `height` spinner
 * would cross 0.6 somewhere in the middle of its range and silently disconnect
 * itself from the map, with nothing to see and nothing thrown.
 *
 * ## Author it as a chain
 *
 * `MapBuilder` samples the terrain ONCE, at a placement's own centre, so a long
 * walk over anything but level ground floats at one end and buries itself at
 * the other — the problem `terrainSlab` solves for roads, which is not
 * available here because a boardwalk is a collider and a road is not. The fix
 * is authoring: lay a run as two or three 9–16 m placements so each samples its
 * own ground. Adjacent decks whose heights differ by less than `HEIGHT_EPS`
 * merge into one nav surface, so the joints cost nothing.
 *
 * ## Raising one with a layout `y` is a different building
 *
 * Nothing stops a placement lifting a walk a storey — Greyfen's treeline hamlet
 * does exactly that — but it spends the causeway contract above: past
 * `stepHeight` the deck stops linking to the ground anywhere along its length,
 * and past `HEADROOM` the ground underneath comes back as an approach you can
 * fight along. That is a fine thing to build ON PURPOSE, and `buildStairs` is
 * then not decoration but the only way up. There is nothing in between: a walk
 * lifted into the dead band between the two is a deck nothing can reach and
 * nothing can pass under.

 * ## What it is for
 *
 * `buildBoardwalk` puts its deck inside `stepHeight` so a causeway links to the
 * ground along its whole length and needs no access at all. Author the same
 * walk with a `y` in the layout — a village raised over marsh, a deck along a
 * bank — and every one of those links is gone: the deck is a surface in the air
 * with `HEADROOM` under it, walkable, reachable from nowhere, and silent about
 * it. This is the piece that reconnects it, and it serves a terrace lip, a
 * jetty over a cut bank or a hut platform on a rise just as well.
 *
 * ## How to place one
 *
 * It climbs toward **+Z**, like `buildRamp`, and the placement point is the
 * MIDDLE of the run — so the treads arrive at `length / 2` ahead of it, where
 * `length` is `height / STAIR_GRADE` and is derived rather than authored (see
 * that constant). Butt that arrival against the deck's own edge and the joint
 * costs nothing: the last stair cell and the first deck cell are neighbours
 * within a step, and `NavGrid`'s `HEIGHT_EPS` merges them where they coincide.
 *
 * Two things to keep to. **Both ends want ground the placement's own centre
 * sample is honest about** — a flight is 7 m long at a 2.5 m rise and one
 * height sample serves all of it, which is the authoring rule the boardwalk's
 * header states from the other side. And **do not run one narrower than about
 * 1.6 m**: the nav grid samples one point per 1.5 m cell, so a narrow flight is
 * a chain of surfaces the sampler misses between, and it stops linking to
 * itself before it stops looking like a stair.
