/**
 * kit/core.ts — Shared foundation for the parametric structure builders:
 * the Structure/BoxSpec/BuildParams/LocalLight types, the village palette,
 * and the Build accumulator every builder uses.
 *
 * Contract (applies to every builder in this directory):
 * - Builders assemble geometry AT THE ORIGIN, UNROTATED and return parallel
 *   local-space lists (meshes / colliders / lights). MapBuilder merges the
 *   meshes per colour and then transforms all three into place — building at
 *   identity is what makes MergeMeshes safe (same trick as
 *   RifleModel.buildRifle).
 * - A builder may take a BuildCtx to read where it is about to end up (the
 *   road bends onto the ground under it). That is a licence to SAMPLE the
 *   world, not to build in it: the geometry returned is still origin-local,
 *   because MapBuilder still rotates and translates it.
 * - Builders NEVER set metadata.solid, checkCollisions, or isPickable — the
 *   visual/collider split is MapBuilder's job; builders only declare where
 *   collider boxes go, and what kind: `BoxSpec.porous` is the one property of
 *   a collider a builder decides, because only the builder knows its box is
 *   standing in for a shape that is mostly gaps.
 * - Collider top faces must stay within CONFIG.nav.stepHeight of adjacent
 *   ground or the nav flood fill never reaches them. Ramp colliders need
 *   rotX, not just the visual.
 * - A rail at the edge of a walkable surface is `guard()`, never a bare `box()`
 *   and never a `wall()` on the edge itself. It has to be solid (a rail you
 *   walk through is a fall) AND it has to stand off the surface (a rail on it
 *   costs the nav grid a cell). That method owns the argument; the watchtower,
 *   the bridge and the barn were each written the wrong way first.
 * - No Hollowmere special-casing; register new builders in
 *   BuildingKit.ts's BUILDERS.

   * This exists for open-frame geometry, whose collider is honest about the

   * solid mass is decoration: the round stops on the concrete either way, so
   * breaking it changes nothing you can play with and takes the elevation's
   * word for what is inside with it — a shopfront that shatters into a blank
   * grey shaft says plainly that the building is a box. A tower's curtain wall

   * ground-floor SHOPFRONTS — the two offices' and the eight shophouses' — are
   * the whole of what does break, because behind those there is a room.

   * in the game, `probeGround` — the most expensive per-frame call there is —

   * is already handled by a `block` covering the whole run, coarsely, the way
   * a fence's one 1.4 m slab stands in for a line of posts. Splitting them is
   * what lets the coarse box be `porous` (a body walks into a fence, a round
   * does not stop on the gaps) while the timber still stops what hits it.
   *
   * A strut costs a collider that is NOT a `WorldBox`: no nav grid, no cover,
   * no obstacle field, no AO. That is deliberate and it is why the coarse box
   * is not optional — the navigation half of a fence is that box's job, and a
   * 0.18 m post is a shape `NavGrid` cannot represent anyway (see `guard`).
   * `MapBuilder` merges a placement's struts into ONE collider mesh, which is
   * what makes the fidelity affordable: measured over Hollowmere's fences, 161
   * loose post/rail boxes cost every ray in the game ~17%, and the same
   * geometry merged per fence costs the ground probe 1.4% and a shot 0.3%.

  /**
   * A pane of glass — and, where something can get in behind it, the one thing
   * in the world a round can take away.
   *
   * The fourth box word, and the only one whose geometry leaves `meshes`. A
   * pane passes a round like a `porous` `block` and is the only thing in the
   * world drawn SEE-THROUGH (`CelMaterialFactory.getGlass` — a reflection of
   * the sky over the tint of whatever stands behind it). A `breakable` one
   * also keeps an identity through both of `MapBuilder`'s merges, so
   * `GlassSystem` can collapse this sheet and no other when something crosses
   * it; the rest are glazing, drawn and nothing more. See `PaneSpec` for which
   * a sheet should be and why the answer is what is BEHIND it.
   *
   * The colour is the caller's because a shopfront and a windscreen are not the
   * same glass, but it is `GLASS` by default for the same reason `surface` has
   * one: the common case should need no thought.
   *
   * **A sheet may RAKE, and only in the drawing.** `rotZ` tilts one out of
   * vertical — a windscreen is the whole reason it exists, and that tilt is
   * what makes a car's cabin a cabin rather than a glass box — and it stops at
   * this mesh, which is why it is an option here and NOT a field on
   * `PaneSpec`. Everything downstream of the spec describes a sheet in a wall
   * with six numbers and a yaw: the collider a breakable pane spawns, the
   * `WorldPane` the wire names it by, and `GlassSystem`'s sweep, which tests a
   * plane it assumes is upright. All three would silently stand a raked sheet
   * back up, so the two are mutually exclusive and the guard is a throw rather
   * than a comment. Glazing may lean; glass that BREAKS is a sheet in a wall.
   *
   * **A sheet may also be `backed`, which is a claim about the WORLD and the
   * one thing here a builder can get wrong invisibly.** It says there is an
   * opaque surface a hand behind this glass, so nothing is ever seen through
   * it — a curtain wall on its shaft, a sash drawn on a solid wall, a
   * clerestory on brick. What it buys is that the sheet is drawn OPAQUE
   * (`CelMaterialFactory.getGlass`), which is one shading of that pixel
   * instead of two and lets the mass behind it be rejected on depth before it
   * is shaded at all; on a map whose elevations are mostly glass that is the
   * largest per-pixel saving there is.
   *
   * **The value is that mass's own palette colour, not a flag**, and that is
   * what makes the drawing exact rather than merely close: the shader folds
   * the blend it is replacing into one expression over the backdrop (see
   * `CEL_GLASS_BACKED` in `CelShader.ts`), so naming the wall reproduces what
   * you would have seen through the glass instead of guessing at it. Pass what
   * the wall behind is actually built from — `b.box(..., CONCRETE)` behind it
   * means `{ backed: CONCRETE }` — and the two move together when a builder
   * repaints.
   *
   * What it costs if the claim is FALSE is a window with a flat sheet where the
   * room should be, and nothing throws, because the geometry is legal either
   * way. So it is opt-in, it is never inferred, and the test is what a ROUND
   * does: if a round stops on something solid within centimetres, the eye stops
   * there too.
   *
   * `backed` and `breakable` are opposites rather than merely exclusive —
   * `PaneSpec.breakable` means enterable space behind, which is the one thing
   * `backed` swears there is not — so claiming both is a contradiction and
   * throws rather than picking one.
   *
   * Like `rotZ` and unlike `breakable`, this stops at the material and is NOT
   * a field on `PaneSpec`: nothing downstream of the spec has heard of it,
   * because a `backed` sheet by construction never becomes a `WorldPane`.

  /**
   * A guard rail along the edge of a walkable surface: solid, and standing
   * OUTBOARD of the surface it guards.
   *
   * This exists because a rail is a third thing the kit had no word for, and
   * every builder that wanted one had to rederive it. `box` is a visual and
   * `wall` is a visual plus a collider — but a rail is thin, and thinness is
   * what `NavGrid` cannot represent. It samples ONE point per 1.5 m cell, so a
   * 0.16 m rail is invisible to it about nine times in ten and, the tenth time,
   * catches a cell centre and does two things: invents a standable surface a
   * rail's height in the air that the flood fill can never reach, and blanks
   * the real floor underneath. Only the first is fixable in the grid — stop
   * `clearBlocked` blanking the cell and `severLinks` isolates it instead, and
   * `severLinks` cannot be relaxed by width because a fence is 0.4 m deep and a
   * dry-stone wall 0.5 m and both must go on severing.
   *
   * So the cell is lost whenever a sample lands in a rail, and the only fix is
   * to not put the rail where the walked surface is sampled. Standing it off
   * the edge is that fix, and having it here rather than in each builder is
   * what stops the next one forgetting: the barn's rails were left visual-only
   * for exactly this reason and you could walk straight off its ramp.
   *
   * **A guard is not a `strut`, and the difference is what is behind it.** A
   * deck rail is a solid surface at the edge of somewhere a body stands: it has
   * to stop a body (a rail you walk through is a fall) and it stops rounds like
   * any other timber, so it is an ordinary collider. A strut is for the case
   * where a COARSER box already owns the body and the fine geometry is only
   * there to catch rounds. Using a strut here would drop the player off the
   * ramp; using a guard for a fence's posts would put its rails in the nav
   * graph, which is the pathology this comment already describes.
   *
   * `edge` is the guarded surface's OUTER face on `side`'s axis, `along` and
   * `length` describe the run on the other horizontal axis, and `surface` is
   * the walked height at the run's centre. A pitched run (`pitch`, positive
   * rising toward +Z) must run along Z, so its `side` is ±x; its section is cut
   * by `cos` so the top face sits `height` above the walked surface at every
   * point rather than `height / cos`, which is what lets a ramp's rail meet a
   * deck's in one line.
