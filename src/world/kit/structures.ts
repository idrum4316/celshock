/**
 * kit/structures.ts — Small standalone structures and cover: silo, well,

 * the contract in kit/core.ts (origin-local geometry, no

 *
 * Cover vocabulary, so a layout can pick the right height deliberately:
 * fence and trough are *low* (step over with the eyes, not the body), cart,

 * Two things here are walked ON rather than hidden behind — the two bridges and
 * the temple — so they additionally owe what kit/terrain.ts's header states:
 * collider top faces within CONFIG.nav.stepHeight of adjacent ground, and rotX

/**
 * A timber trestle carried on raked pile bents, with a graded approach at each
 * end: the plantation road's way over a river, and the piece that makes a
 * colonial valley read as settled rather than merely built on.
 *
 * ## Local zero is BANK grade, not the ground under the centre
 *
 * This is the one thing to get right when placing one. `MapBuilder` samples the
 * terrain ONCE, at the placement's own (x, z), and translates the whole
 * structure by it — and a bridge's centre is over the CHANNEL, so that sample
 * is the river bed. Left alone the whole trestle sinks by the bed's depth and
 * both ramp feet end up floating a metre over the banks, severing everything.
 *
 * The fix is one authored number in the layout: give the placement a `y` equal
 * to minus the bed depth at its centre, so local zero lands back at bank grade
 * and the feet bury themselves by `TRESTLE_DROP` as intended.
 *
 * It could instead read `BuildCtx` and derive that itself. It deliberately does
 * not: that would put it in `CONFORMS_TO_TERRAIN`, whose members the editor
 * REBUILDS rather than translates on every frame of a drag (~570 ms against
 * sub-ms), and a landmark placed once does not need to cost that. If a second
 * trestle ever lands somewhere awkward, this is the thing to change.
 *
 * ## Why the deck is 1.6 m up, which is not a choice
 *
 * A deck low enough to link to a 0-height bank without ramps needs its top at
 * or under `stepHeight` (0.6). A deck high enough for the river bed underneath
 * to stay walkable needs its UNDERSIDE more than `HEADROOM` (1.7) above that
 * bed, or `severLinks` cuts every link crossing it and `clearBlocked` blanks the
 * ground beneath — an invisible wall across the channel, exactly where a player
 * would run under a bridge. Over a 1.34 m bed with a 0.6 m slab those two want
 * `top <= 0.6` and `top > 0.66`. No height does both.
 *
 * So the ramps are not decoration. They are the only way to have a deck you
 * walk over AND a river you can wade under, and at 1.6 m the underside clears
 * the bed by 2.34 m with room to spare.
 *
 * ## It runs along Z, and must
 *
 * `Build.guard` throws in DEV on a pitched run that is not along Z, because a
 * pitched rail turns about X. The ramps are pitched and railed, so the whole
 * structure is built along Z and turned by the placement's `rotY` — the same
 * rule every other pitched slab in the kit follows.

 * A stepped stone platform with the jungle growing over it: three tiers, a

 * column lying where it fell.
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * It is the only elevation in the kit that needs no ramp, no stair and no
 * doorway. Every tier is a step inside `stepHeight`, so it is walked up from
 * any bearing by anything with feet — which makes it high ground a bot can hold
 * without the pathing having to be clever, and high ground a player can be
 * pushed off from four sides at once. The watchtower and the barn loft are
 * verticality with ONE way up; this is the opposite of that on purpose.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `guard` anywhere on it. A rail would turn a platform
 * you can leave in any direction into a fortress with one entrance, and would
 * cost a nav cell on every face.
 *
 * ## The colliders are RINGS, and the whole thing turns on it
 *
 * The obvious build is three nested solid boxes. It looks right, it walks right
 * in the editor, and it silently loses its top tier. `NavGrid` keeps
 * MAX_SURFACES = 3 per cell and `addSurface` RETURNS when it is full — so trace
 * a cell at the centre: terrain goes in, tier 1's top goes in, tier 2's top goes
 * in, and tier 3's top — the summit, the only part anyone climbs for — is
 * dropped. Nothing throws, nothing draws differently, and the flag on top is
 * unstandable.
 *
 * So each tier's COLLIDER is only the ring of tread it actually exposes.
 * `topFaceHeight` returns null outside a box's own XZ footprint and
 * `NavGrid.rasterize` skips on null, so a cell centre lands inside exactly one
 * ring and every cell carries two surfaces instead of four.
 *
 * The VISUALS stay three nested solid boxes, and that is what satisfies the
 * thick-box rule: every walked tread is the top face of a 0.85–1.75 m block, so
 * the outline shell has real depth behind it and cannot paint the tread flat in
 * its own ink. They are also all one colour, so they merge into a single mesh
 * and their buried coplanar faces cannot be a depth-test tie.
 *
 * ## The nav budget, which is the thing to preserve
 *
 * | cell | surfaces |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | off the temple | terrain |
 * | on any tread | terrain (blocked) + that tread |
 * | under a stele, the wall, or the column | terrain + tread + that thing's top |
 *
 * Never four. So: no fourth tier, no nested solid COLLIDERS, and nothing new
 * standing in a cell that already carries two treads.
