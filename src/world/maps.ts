/**
 * maps.ts — The playable maps, as data: what a map IS, and which ones exist.
 * Owns: the `MapDef` pairing of a layout with the environment it is lit and
 * fogged by, and the registry `Game` picks one out of.
 * Invariants: the two halves travel together. A layout is placements and a
 * heightfield; an `EnvironmentSpec` is the palette, fog, sky and particles it
 * is meant to be seen under, and building one against the other's environment
 * gives a night village in daylight fog. Pairing them here is what stops the
 * orchestrator from having to know either name.
 *
 * This is the file a second map is added to, and — with its own `layout.ts`,
 * `heights.ts` and `environment.ts` under a directory of its own — the ONLY
 * existing file it has to touch. Nothing downstream may import a map's modules
 * directly: `Game` holds a `MapDef`, `MapBuilder.build` takes both halves as
 * arguments, and neither special-cases any particular map.
