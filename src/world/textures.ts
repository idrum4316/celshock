/**
 * textures.ts — Runtime-generated canvas textures: the village street's
 * cobbles and the valley floor's own surfaces, painted per texel out of
 * deterministic noise and cached per scene. Zero asset files.
 * Owns: the tiling noise primitives, one field recipe per surface, and the two
 * painters that turn a field into an albedo and into a height map.
 * Invariants: SIZE must stay a power of two for mipmaps AND must stay 512 —
 * `CelShader`'s bump tap is a hard-coded `1.0 / 512.0` and reads the albedo and
 * the height map as the same size; every field is periodic over the tile, so
 * nothing may sample a lattice or a cell grid without wrapping; and
 * anisotropicFilteringLevel stays 8 or the ground shimmers at grazing angles.
 *
 * **A surface is a FIELD, not a scatter of shapes.** Every tone and every
 * height here is a function evaluated at a texel, and the pixels are written
 * once through `putImageData`. The version this replaced drew each surface as a
 * few hundred filled ellipses, and it failed for a reason worth keeping: an
 * ellipse has a silhouette, and at any tile scale that keeps the repeat
 * invisible (4 m for `dirt`) its grains land at 10–30 cm — coin-sized, in front
 * of a camera 1.55 m up. The eye reads a circle at that size as an OBJECT, so
 * the valley floor came back as a heap of pancakes rather than as soil, and the
 * matching height map turned every one of them into a raised disc with a hard
 * rim, which is what the light bands then traced. No amount of retuning the
 * radii fixes that: the shape is the problem.
 *
 * So the shapes that survive here come from **cellular noise over a warped
 * domain** — Voronoi cells, which are irregular polygons, which tile the plane
 * with nothing showing between them, and whose distance-to-border is exactly
 * the groove a height map wants. A clod is a cell, a sett is a cell, a gravel
 * stone is a cell. Nothing in this file draws a disc any more.
 *
 * Style rules (what keeps these cel-shaded rather than gritty):
 * - the albedo is POSTERIZED — the tone field is quantized into a handful of
 *   flat levels before it becomes a colour, which is how "flat tones only, no
 *   gradients" survives a generator that works per texel. The fine grain is
 *   added BEFORE the quantization on purpose: it breaks the level boundaries
 *   into a stipple instead of leaving contour lines across the ground;
 * - the relief carries the detail and the albedo stays quiet. The shader's
 *   quantized bands ripple over the height map, and that read is free; the same
 *   detail spent on albedo contrast is what made the old surfaces spotty;
 * - low contrast between levels, and the darkest tone belongs in the grooves.
 *
 * Textures are authored in display space and sampled raw, matching the
 * no-image-processing pipeline (same convention as the player skin).
