/**
 * OutlineFog.ts — Per-pixel distance fog for Babylon's outline pass.
 * Owns: the patched `outlineVertexShader`/`outlinePixelShader` sources, and the
 * one place in this tree that reaches into Babylon's compiled-effect cache.
 * Invariants: the fog it bakes must be the SAME fog the cel shader is given —
 * `CelMaterialFactory.setEnvironment` is the only caller, so the ink and the
 * surface under it cannot describe different weather. Patching is anchored on
 * Babylon's own `#define CUSTOM_*` markers and throws in dev if one is missing,
 * because the failure mode of a silent miss is the bug this exists to fix.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT DONE THE OBVIOUS WAY. An outline is a back-face shell drawn
 * by Babylon's `OutlineRenderer`, whose entire fragment shader is
 * `gl_FragColor = color` — a flat per-MESH colour, no fog, no depth. Fading
 * that colour on the CPU (which `updateOutlineScales` did first, and still does
 * for width) can only ever be per mesh, and per mesh is not enough here:
 * `BlockMerge` collapses the map into one mesh per 48 m block per material, so
 * a single mesh routinely spans the whole fog band. Measured on Greyfen: of 687
 * outlined meshes, 50 had fog 0.0 at their near edge and 1.0 at their far edge.
 * Those 50 are the village. The symptom is ink hanging in clear black lines
 * over walls that have already dissolved into the fog wall.
 *
 * THE TWO THINGS THAT MAKE A PER-PIXEL FADE POSSIBLE WITHOUT A UNIFORM.
 * `OutlineRenderer` builds its effect with a hardcoded `uniformsNames` list and
 * offers no hook to extend it, so a new uniform cannot be bound at all — every
 * value the fade needs has to be recovered from what is already there:
 *
 * - **Distance** comes from `viewProjection`. Rows 0, 1 and 3 of a perspective
 *   view-projection are `P00 * right`, `P11 * up` and `forward`; the view
 *   rotation is orthonormal, so `forward` is unit length and the other two
 *   normalise by their own length. The eye is the one point whose clip x, y and
 *   w all vanish, which those three rows give directly — no matrix inverse, so
 *   it compiles under GLSL ES 1.00 (a WebGL2 context still runs these shaders
 *   in 1.00 mode, where `inverse`/`transpose` do not exist). The result is
 *   `length(worldPos - eye)`, the SAME radial distance the cel shader fogs by.
 *   Using `gl_Position.w` instead would have been free, but planar depth
 *   disagrees with radial by up to 1.4x at the corners of a 54 deg FOV, and an
 *   outline that fogs differently from its own surface is this bug again.
 * - **Fog colour and range** are baked into the source as literals, because
 *   there is nowhere to put them. That is what `setOutlineFog` re-bakes, and
 *   why it has to drop the compiled programs.
 *
 * WHAT THE INVALIDATION COSTS. `Engine.createEffect` caches on shader NAME plus
 * defines, never on source, so a re-bake is invisible to it and the stale
 * program would be handed back forever — and `OutlineRenderer` compounds it by
 * asking the cache for an effect only when its DEFINES change, which is never.
 * `dropCompiled` is what forces the recompile, and every one of its rules was
 * paid for in a bug — see it.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THIS FILE MUST NEVER DO is statically import a Babylon shader
 * module to get at its source. See `applyWanted`. It cost a whole debugging
 * session: the symptom is not in the renderer at all.

 * Forgets every compiled outline program so the next draw compiles the re-baked

 * is keyed `"<vertex>+<fragment>@<defines>"` and the outline pass names both
 * halves `outline`, so that prefix takes this shader's variants (skinned,
 * instanced) and nothing else — the alternative, `releaseEffects()`, would
 * recompile the cel materials, the post-process chain and the sky on every
 * round start.
 *
 * **`_releaseEffect` is still not the way to do it.** It deletes the GL program
 * on the spot, and a draw wrapper holding that `Effect` then draws with a
 * deleted program — undefined behaviour, and the sort that shows up as damage to
 * whatever renders next rather than to the outline. Clearing the wrappers first
 * and letting the count fall is the same freeing done in the one order where
 * nothing is left pointing at it; see the note on immediacy below, which is the
 * bug that taught this file the difference.
 *
 * **The reset is what actually re-bakes anything; the cache delete alone does
 * nothing.** `OutlineRenderer.isReady` asks the engine for an effect only when
 * its DEFINES string changes — `if (cachedDefines !== join)` — and the outline
 * pass's defines never change for a given mesh. So a draw wrapper that already
 * holds an effect will never consult the cache again however many entries are
 * forgotten. Clearing the wrapper is the only way to make it ask, and the delete
 * exists so that what it then asks for is compiled from the re-baked source.
 *
 * **It walks EVERY mesh, and must not be filtered on `renderOutline`.** That
 * looks like the right set — it is the set the outline pass draws — but the flag
 * is a RUNTIME TOGGLE: `Bot.setOutlines` clears it past `lodOutlineDistance`
 * (20 m), so at any instant most bot rigs have it off, and bot rigs are POOLED —
 * built once, never disposed, alive across every map change. A rig that drew
 * under the old bake and was LOD'd out at the moment of the new one kept its
 * wrapper and went on drawing the previous map's fog for the rest of the
 * session. Measured on greyfen -> hollowmere: 148 wrappers still mixing ink to
 * Greyfen's `#c2ccd4`, which at the fog wall IS the ink — a bot's nine merged
 * meshes read as a scatter of white slivers over the village. Filtering on the
 * outline REGISTRY was the same mistake one layer along: it misses `ViewModel`'s
 * ~40 meshes, which set `renderOutline` by hand and never register (distance
 * thinning is meaningless 0.5 m from the lens). There is no cheap set that is
 * right, because anything may have the flag flipped on later; the whole scene is
 * the honest answer, and it is affordable: 4.9 ms for Hollowmere's 1,910 meshes
 * across the four outline passes, once per fog change, against the ~570 ms the
 * map build beside it costs. Only the outline keys are dropped, so everything
 * else re-fetches its effect from the cache on the next frame rather than
 * recompiling.
 *
 * **The reset must be IMMEDIATE, and it must come BEFORE the cache delete.**
 * `resetDrawCache()` defaults to `immediate = false`, which does not merely
 * forget each discarded wrapper — it QUEUES that wrapper's `Effect.dispose()` on
 * the engine's `endFrame` observable, and a dispose is a REF RELEASE: Babylon
 * ref-counts an effect by how many wrappers asked `createEffect` for it, and the
 * one that takes the count to zero deletes the GL program and removes the cache
 * entry itself. Deleting the entry by hand first is what desynchronises that
 * count. The bake happens inside `startRound`, so the order used to be: forget
 * the entry, clear ~500 wrappers with their releases still pending, build and
 * render the new map — which compiles a fresh effect (the entry is gone) and
 * hands it to every wrapper the frame rebuilds — and only THEN, at `endFrame`,
 * do the queued releases land and drive a live generation's count to zero. Its
 * program is deleted under the wrappers still pointing at it, which is precisely
 * the undefined behaviour this comment used to promise `delete` avoided.
 *
 * What it looks like is the whole point: the map is rebuilt after the bake, so
 * its meshes are innocent, and the damage lands only on the geometry that
 * SURVIVES a map change — the pooled bot rigs and the viewmodel. Their outline
 * shells draw from a deleted program as garbage that swallows the body it
 * belongs to, so on Greyfen's pale fog a squad reads as flat yellow cut-outs of
 * itself (measured: 534 of 642 outline wrappers holding a freed effect one
 * switch in, and it compounds with every further switch). On Hollowmere the same
 * garbage is near-black against near-black and invisible, which is why this
 * survived a whole map.
 *
 * Resetting immediately puts the releases back inside the bake, where the last
 * one frees the effect while nothing holds it and Babylon drops its own cache
 * entry. The delete that follows is a backstop for the case where some ref
 * outlives the walk: by then no wrapper points at the effect, so forgetting it
 * strands nobody and costs at worst a leaked program.
 *
 * This is the only place the game touches Babylon's effect cache. There is no
 * public equivalent: `createEffect` never consults the source it caches.
