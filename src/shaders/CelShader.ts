/**
 * CelShader.ts — The look: custom cel ShaderMaterial (banded directional key +
 * up to MAX_POINT_LIGHTS=16 dynamic point lights + ambient, fog, ground mist,
 * rim, hard stepped shadows, opt-in toon specular) and CelMaterialFactory,
 * the cache every lit material comes from.
 * Invariants: the scene's ONLY Babylon light is ShadowSystem's shadow-camera
 * DirectionalLight, which no material reads — light arrives via these
 * uniforms, uploaded by LightingSystem once per frame. Flat/faceted shading is
 * recovered in the fragment shader from screen-space derivatives — NEVER call
 * convertToFlatShadedMesh(). Output is display-ready color, which is why
 * pipeline.imageProcessingEnabled must stay false. Output is also opaque —
 * gl_FragColor's alpha is 1 for every variant but getGlass(), the world's one
 * alpha-blended material, which writes a Fresnel alpha, needs no depth write
 * (see there, and MapBuilder's pane rules), carries the one depth bias in
 * the renderer — GLASS_DEPTH_UNITS, without which a pane past ~100 m is not
 * drawn at all — and is the one variant that samples anything the renderer
 * drew for itself (setReflection, whose cube ReflectionSystem bakes and whose
 * strength is 0 until it has). Materials are cached/shared per color — don't create per-mesh
 * materials. A NEW material is seeded with
 * every piece of shared state on the spot (applyCamera/applyEnvironment/
 * applyPointLights/applyShadow): the per-frame walks are guarded on change and
 * skip a still frame entirely, so what a material is born with is what it keeps
 * until that state next moves. addOutline() skips meshes with
 * metadata.noOutline, tints the ink from the mesh's own cel colour, and
 * registers the mesh for updateOutlineScales() (distance thinning, prunes
 * disposed meshes). Effect meshes use getEmissive() (unlit StandardMaterial).
 * Also owns the fog as a published fact: setEnvironment writes it once, the cel
 * materials get it as uniforms, OutlineFog bakes it into the outline pass,
 * EmissiveFog uploads it to the unlit emissive materials, and fogAmountAt()
 * hands the same curve to the GlowLayer. Anything else drawn unshaded owes that
 * fade, or it hangs in front of the fog wall at full strength.

/**
 * Custom cel-shading: quantized diffuse bands, a hard stylized rim highlight,
 * flat colors (or a texture albedo — uv-mapped for the skinned player body,
 * world-XZ-mapped for ground surfaces like cobblestone roads), and per-theme
 * atmosphere blended in the fragment shader. Ground-textured materials may
 * also carry a matching height map (CEL_BUMP): the facet normal is perturbed
 * by the height slope, measured from world-space taps a texel apart — never
 * from screen-space derivatives, which make the relief boil as the player walks
 * (see perturbNormal) — so the light bands ripple across individual
 * cobblestones.
 * Outlines are drawn with Babylon's outline renderer (inverted hull).
 *
 * Lighting has four parts, all banded so the toon look survives:
 * - a directional key light (moon/sun) quantized into 4 hard bands and gated
 *   by a hard two-level shadow term (ShadowSystem's depth map — lit or not,
 *   never a soft penumbra),
 * - up to `MAX_POINT_LIGHTS` dynamic point lights (torches, neon, muzzle
 *   flashes) quantized into 3 bands with a smooth radial falloff, and
 * - a flat ambient term that sets how black the unlit side goes — the main
 *   dial for the horror mood. Point lights deliberately ignore the shadow
 *   map, so a lantern still warms ground the moon can't reach.
 * Opt-in per material (getGlossy / getGroundTextured's spec): a toon
 * specular — one two-band Blinn highlight from the key light, gated by the
 * same shadow. Everything not explicitly glossy stays matte.
 * Opt-in the same way (getTranslucent): a translucency band — the key light
 * coming THROUGH a thin surface rather than off it, for awnings and foliage.
 * Everything not explicitly translucent stays opaque.
 * Opt-in at COMPILE time (getGlass, `#define CEL_GLASS`): a pane of glazing —
 * a Fresnel between what is behind it and a reflection of the sky with the
 * city composited into it, written out as a per-pixel alpha. A define rather
 * than a uniform because, unlike the two above, its terms cannot be multiplied
 * out to nothing by a zero colour: a reflect(), a pow(), a sky gradient and a
 * cube fetch on every pixel of the world is not a price the other thousand
 * meshes should pay to keep the roster uniform.
 *
 * The rim highlight is gated OFF near-level surfaces, and must stay that way:
 * on a plane the grazing angle is just the distance from the eye, so an
 * ungated rim draws a hard-edged, camera-locked disc on the floor that slides
 * around with the player. See the gate itself for the measurement.
 *
 * Atmosphere is distance fog plus a separate height-based ground mist, so
 * arenas fade into darkness and the floor sits in a low-lying haze.
 *
 * Shading is faceted: the fragment shader recovers each triangle's geometric
 * normal from screen-space derivatives of the world position rather than
 * using the interpolated vertex normal. Every mesh in the game is built from
 * coarse primitives, so hard facets are the intended look — and doing it in
 * the shader avoids `convertToFlatShadedMesh()`, which would unweld vertices
 * on every prop, enemy, and clone.

   * inside 5 cm of the eye — and against a 24-bit buffer that leaves a step of
   * 1 cm at 90 m, 3 cm at 160 m and 27 cm at the fog wall, while the standoff
   * stays what the builder gave it. Measured on Coldharbour's curtain wall,
   * square on, with the pane held at a constant size on screen: full at 40 and
   * 90 m, **gone entirely from 130 m out** — the tower goes back to being blank
   * concrete, with nothing wrong in the shader and nothing wrong in the
   * geometry.
   *
   * A polygon offset is the fix rather than a workaround because it is stated
   * in exactly the units the problem is: it scales with the buffer's step at
   * the fragment's own depth, so it is millimetres up close, where the pane
   * needs nothing, and metres at the far end of the map, where the buffer's own
   * step is that coarse. Nothing else on offer moves: `maxZ` is worth nothing
   * (measured — the near plane is the whole of the precision), a bigger
   * standoff would have to be half a metre of glass proud of the wall by the
   * fog wall, and the near plane is spoken for.
   *
   * Sixteen against a measured knee of eight, because `r` is
   * implementation-defined and this was measured on one implementation. What it
   * costs at the far end is that the fins and collars standing 0.1-0.2 m proud
   * of the glass are overdrawn by it past ~100 m, where they are a pixel or two
   * of trim — against a whole elevation of glazing, which is the thing the
   * player can actually see.
   *
   * Only the depth TEST is biased: a blended draw writes no depth (see
   * `getGlass`), so nothing downstream inherits the offset.

   * The INK for a surface that moves — an inverted hull drawn through this
   * shader instead of through Babylon's outline pass.
   *
   * **It exists because Babylon's hull cannot follow a vertex-animated
   * surface, and that is a fact about its renderer rather than a taste.**
   * `OutlineRenderer.isReady` builds its effect with a hardcoded attribute list
   * of position and normal — `const color = false`, literally — and a hardcoded
   * `uniformsNames` with no clock in it. So the hull can see neither the wind
   * nor the per-vertex weight, and a swaying leaf leans out from under a shell
   * left standing at the rest pose: a third of a metre against a five
   * centimetre line, which reads as a dark ghost of the still canopy hanging
   * behind the moving one. Everything the hull needs is already in THIS shader,
   * so the answer is to draw it here.
   *
   * Three things fall out of that which are worth having on their own:
   *
   * - **The width is thinned per VERTEX**, against the same eye the fog uses,
   *   rather than per mesh by `updateOutlineScales`. That is a correction:
   *   `BlockMerge` hands out meshes that span the whole fog band (measured: 50
   *   of 687), and the ink's COLOUR fade was already moved per pixel for
   *   exactly that reason. This is the width catching up.
   * - **The fade is the surface's own**, computed from the same `fogParams`
   *   and `mistParams` in the same block, so the line over a wall dissolves on
   *   the curve the wall dissolves on. `OutlineFog` has to bake literals into
   *   Babylon's shader and drop compiled programs to get half of this, and
   *   cannot get the ground mist at all.
   * - **It is ONE draw rather than two.** Babylon renders an opaque mesh's
   *   outline twice — once before with depth-write off, once after with
   *   colour-write off to repair the depth buffer. An inverted hull with
   *   `cullBackFaces = false` and ordinary depth state needs neither pass.
   *
   * Keyed on the SOURCE material's name rather than on a hex, so `inkColorFor`
   * resolves exactly the colour `outlineInkFor` would have given the same
   * surface, and a matte and a translucent green get their own entries the way
   * they already do everywhere else in this cache.

  /**
   * The glazing material: the same flat cel colour as get(), composited over

   *
   * **It comes in two, and which one is a statement about what stands BEHIND
   * the sheet rather than about how it should look.** `backed` glazing has a
   * solid mass a hand behind it — a tower's curtain wall on its shaft, a
   * shophouse's drawn sash, a clerestory on brick — so nothing is ever seen
   * through it and it is drawn OPAQUE: one shading of that pixel instead of
   * two, and the mass behind it rejected on depth before it is shaded at all.
   * Everything else is blended, and it is blended because something back there
   * is meant to be legible: the twenty-four shopfronts with a room behind them
   * (`tint` exists so a lit interior reads from the pavement) and a car's
   * greenhouse, which `buildCar` models a dash and seat backs into for exactly
   * that reason. `Build.pane` is where the claim is made; see it for why a
   * `backed` sheet can never also be `breakable`.
   *
   * **The blended one is the only ALPHA-BLENDED material in the world layer**,
   * and it is the only thing that has any business being one. Everything else
   * here is a flat opaque cel colour, the water fakes its depth with a fresnel
   * between two opaque colours rather than showing the bed through itself, and
   * the only other transparent thing in the scene at all is the capture zone's
   * skirt, which is annotation rather than world. What blending costs is the
   * two things it always costs and they are paid for below in `MapBuilder`: a
   * pane writes no depth and so is sorted rather than z-buffered, and it must
   * be neither an outline nor a shadow caster. A `backed` pane wants the last
   * two anyway — the mass it hangs on already casts the shadow and carries the
   * ink — so both flags stay on both kinds and only the depth changes.
   *
   * **Both carry the depth BIAS**, and that is not about transparency at all:
   * a pane hangs centimetres off the wall behind it, which is a gap the depth
   * buffer loses with distance. See `GLASS_DEPTH_UNITS`. On a `backed` sheet it
   * earns a second job — biased toward the eye, the pane wins the depth test
   * against its own mass rather than z-fighting it at range.
   *
   * Cached under its own key and named `cel-glass-#rrggbb` (`-backed` for the
   * opaque twin), like the glossy and translucent variants — though unlike them
   * nothing recovers ink from it, because glass is not outlined. **The key
   * matters beyond the cache**: both of `MapBuilder`'s merges group by
   * MATERIAL, so two variants in one placement fall into two merged meshes
   * without either merge being told that glazing now comes in two kinds.
