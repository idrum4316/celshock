   *
   * Grain over a smear is the symptom if this goes wrong: it reads as a dirty
   * lens rather than as motion, and nothing throws.

   * Both are idempotent, and `attach` additionally refuses while the grade is
   * switched off — the blur's dance is a detach and a re-attach around some
   * other work, and it must not resurrect a pass the player took away. That is
   * also why the grade always APPENDS rather than going back into the slot it
   * came out of, the way `Game.syncGodRays` does: the tail is where it belongs,
   * and a blur attached while it was away is already sitting past its old
