/**
 * editor/terrainBrush.ts — Terrain mode: the hover highlight and the drag that
 * raises or lowers the ground.
 * Owns: the brush state, its overlay mesh, and the heightfield writes a stroke
 * makes. Owns nothing else — the rebuild that brings colliders, navigation and
 * everything standing on the ground back into agreement is the session's call,
 * because it disposes the map the session is holding.
 *
 * Why a mode rather than another selectable entity: the ground is *under*
 * everything, so a terrain proxy is a flat sheet competing for the same click
 * as the water rect, the grass rect and the jetty sitting on it. Whichever
 * annotation happens to be on top wins and the rest become unselectable. A mode
 * settles it by construction — in terrain mode only the ground answers, and in
 * object mode terrain is not in the pick at all.
 *
 * A stroke is ABSOLUTE, not incremental: the affected vertices' heights are
 * snapshotted when the drag starts and every mouse move re-derives them from
 * that snapshot. Accumulating deltas per frame would make the result depend on
 * frame rate and on how fast the mouse was moving.
 *
 * There are two tools, and they differ only in what the stroke re-derives from:
 *
 * - `sculpt` stamps its footprint once and reads a vertical pointer drag, so
 *   the ground rises and falls under a brush that stays put.
 * - `level` samples the height under the first click and then paints, stamping
 *   the footprint wherever the cursor goes and pulling those vertices to that
 *   one height. Free-hand sculpting cannot produce a flat basin floor or a pad
 *   that meets the ground around it — every pass lands somewhere slightly
 *   different, and "slightly different" is exactly what the nav grid's slope
 *   limit and a building's footings care about.
 *
 * Absoluteness is what makes painting settle: a vertex remembers the height it
 * had when the stroke FIRST touched it and the STRONGEST falloff weight any
 * pass has given it, so dragging back and forth over the same ground converges
 * instead of creeping toward the target one pass at a time.
