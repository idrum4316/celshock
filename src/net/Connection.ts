/**
 * net/Connection.ts — The socket to the match server: lifetime, reconnection,
 * and the clock offset every interpolated body is drawn against.
 * Owns: the WebSocket, the inbound message callback, and the estimate of what
 * time it is on the server. Owns no game state — it hands decoded messages
 * upward and knows nothing about rosters, soldiers or rounds.
 * Invariants: never simulates and never interprets. A message arrives, is
 * decoded, and is handed on; anything that decides what a message MEANS belongs
 * to whoever wired `onMessage`.
 *
 * **The clock offset is the load-bearing part.** Every snapshot is stamped with
 * the server's `Date.now()`, and interpolation needs to place those stamps on
 * the local timeline — two machines' wall clocks can differ by minutes, so the
 * stamps are useless raw.
 *
 * One sample is `serverNow - localNow` measured when the message is HANDLED,
 * which is `trueOffset - delay` for a delay made of transit plus however long
 * the main thread took to get to it. That delay is never negative, so every
 * sample UNDERSTATES the offset and the best estimate in a window is the
 * MAXIMUM — the sample that happened to be least delayed. Averaging would bake
 * in the mean queueing delay, and taking the minimum (which this did at first)
 * deliberately picks the worst-delayed sample in the window and drags render
 * time that much further behind. It showed up as a 342 ms apparent skew between
 * a server and a client on the same machine.
