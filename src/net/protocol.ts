 * Vectors cross the wire as plain `[x, y, z]` tuples rather than `Vector3`,

 * `JSON.stringify` nor a `DataView` encoder has any business knowing about.

 * no runtime edge to `CONFIG` while keeping the awards the wire can name and

 * round trip and has no way at all to learn anybody else's, so a board where
 * every row but yours was blank is what a client-measured version buys. It is
 * measured with the WebSocket's own ping/pong frames rather than with a message
 * pair invented here — a browser answers those from its network stack without
 * waking its JavaScript, so the number is about the connection rather than about
 * how busy the far end's page is, and nothing is added to `ClientMessage` for a
 * client to get wrong or to lie about.
 *
 * Indexed by slot and always the full roster's length, like `ScoresMessage`, and
 * **-1 for a slot with nobody on a connection in it** — every bot, and a slot
 * whose peer has not answered its first ping yet. A client reads -1 as "there is
 * no ping here", never as a fast one.
 *
 * Sent on a fixed cadence (about once a second) rather than when it changes,
 * which is the opposite of `scores` and deliberately so: a score moves a few
 * times a minute and a latency moves on every sample, so "when it changes" would
 * mean every time. Sixteen small numbers a second is nothing beside a snapshot
 * stream of twenty a second.
 *
 * Additive, like `fire` and `scores`: an older client ignores a message type it
 * has no case for and a newer client against an older server shows a board with
 * no ping column filled in, so this arrived without a version bump.
