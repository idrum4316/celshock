/**
 * net/NetSession.ts — A networked round, from the client's side.
 * Owns: the `Connection`, the `NetRoster`, the `NetGrenades` pool, the movement
 * upload clock, and the translation of server messages into the callbacks
 * `Game` wires. It is the single seam between the game and the wire.
 * Invariants: `Game` talks to this and never to a socket; this talks to the
 * socket and never to a game system it was not handed. It decides nothing about
 * the round — every outcome here arrived from the authority.
 *
 * It exists so that `Game` gains a field and a branch rather than a protocol.
 * The offline path is untouched: with no session, `updateWorld` runs
 * `ConquestSystem` and `BattleSystem` exactly as it always has, and nothing in
 * this file is constructed at all.
 *
 * **Movement is uploaded, not commanded.** The local `Player` simulates itself
 * exactly as it does offline and this reports where it ended up at `INPUT_HZ`.
 * The server validates and, when it refuses, sends a correction — which is the
 * only thing that ever moves the local body from outside. See
 * `docs/multiplayer.md`.
