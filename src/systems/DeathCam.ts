/**
 * DeathCam.ts — What the player watches after they are killed: a body standing
 * in for them, thrown by the round that did it, and a camera that leaves the
 * head to look at it.
 *
 * Owns two things and nothing else: ONE `SoldierRig` — the bot model, in the
 * player's own team colours — and, each frame, where the camera should be and
 * what it should be looking at. It owns no rules, no screen and not the respawn
 * clock; the cam's own clock runs here but `Game` is what reads it and moves the
 * state on, and `Game` is what hands `eye`/`look` to `CameraSystem.place`.
 *
 * Five things are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **The body is the BOT rig, deliberately.** There is no rigged character
 *   asset in this tree and there must not become one: standing up an imported
 *   body here would pull multiple megabytes into the production bundle for four
 *   seconds of screen time, which is the whole reason the first-person
 *   conversion dropped the one that used to exist. The bot rig is nine merged
 *   meshes, is already what `RAGDOLL_BONES` is measured against, and hands to
 *   `RagdollSystem` with nothing adapted.
 * - **It is a stand-in, not the player.** `Player` has no rig and never grows
 *   one: it is a capsule, a viewmodel and an eye. The corpse is a separate
 *   `RagdollSubject` stood up at the player's last position on the frame they
 *   die and hidden again when the cam ends, so nothing in movement, collision
 *   or hit detection ever gains a mesh to disagree with.
 * - **This body is never refused, and it needs no exception to say so.** Havok
 *   is required, the corpse is at the camera so the pool's one remaining
 *   refusal (distance) cannot reach it, and a full pool evicts its oldest
 *   corpse — which for the whole four seconds is never this one. The cam used
 *   to carry a `priority` flag and a collapse tween for the cases that answer
 *   made and the cases it did not; both are gone.
 * - **The camera's pull-in lives here**, and it is the only occlusion pick in
 *   the game outside combat. `CameraSystem` has none because the camera is
 *   normally inside the head and has nothing to be occluded by; a camera three
 *   metres behind a body that died against a wall has plenty. It is affordable
 *   because `Player.probeGround` — the frame's most expensive pick, ~2.5 ms —
 *   is not running while the player is dead.
 * - **Nothing here simulates.** The ragdoll is stepped by `RagdollSystem` from
 *   `Game.updateGameplay` like every other body; this file only says which body
 *   to throw and where to stand to watch it.
