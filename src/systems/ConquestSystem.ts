 * ConquestSystem.ts — Conquest rules: flags, capture meters, tickets, bleed,

 * Invariants: the meter runs -1..+1 and ownership flips only by crossing 0 —
 * a flag must be neutralised before it changes hands. Occupancy comes from the
 * combatant list Game assembles each frame. update() runs BEFORE
 * BattleSystem.update so bots see this frame's ownership. Events go out via
 * onCaptured/onNeutralised callbacks wired in Game — never import other
 * systems. Squad orders are planned for a whole team at once (planSquads) so
 * squads can be spread — or deliberately stacked — relative to each other; a
 * claimed flag is penalised, never excluded. Round numbers come from
 * CONFIG.conquest, squad ones from CONFIG.bots.squad.
