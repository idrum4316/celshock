/**
 * PhysicsWorld.ts — The one physics engine: the Havok plugin, the map as a
 * single static body, and the fixed-step clock everything under it advances on.
 * Owns: the plugin, the static world, the substep accumulator, and the register
 * of clients that have bodies in it.
 * Owns NO bodies of its own. `RagdollSystem` has the corpses and `DebrisSystem`
 * the shards; this file is what they share, and it is the only place
 * `@babylonjs/havok` is reached.
 *
 * ## Havok is REQUIRED, and that is what makes this file short
 *
 * `loadHavok` is awaited in `main.ts` and the instance is handed to `Game`,
 * which hands it here — so a failure is the boot screen's failure message
 * beside "no WebGL2", and by the time this class exists the engine does too.
 * Every "has it arrived yet" question is therefore gone, and so is every
 * fallback that used to answer one: there is no init state, no `ready`, no
 * pending map, no client built later than its own constructor, and no setting.
 * A body falls under the solver or there is no game for it to fall in.
 *
 * It was not always so, and what the optional version cost is worth stating
 * once. Two code paths for every falling thing — a corpse's collapse tween and
 * a shard's scripted arc — each with its own timing constants, each exercised
 * only on machines nobody was testing on, and both reachable at any moment
 * because the WASM could land mid-round. The engine ships with the build and is
 * precached with it; making it optional bought a fallback for a case that, on a
 * machine that can run the rest of this game, does not happen.
 *
 * Invariants, each of which has a way of failing silently:
 * - `scene.physicsEnabled` is FALSE and stays false. Babylon steps physics from
 *   `scene.animate()` on every RENDERED frame, and this game renders under the
 *   menu, the deploy map and a pause — so a scene-driven step would be the one
 *   thing still moving behind a pause card. Stepping is `update()`'s job and it
 *   is only ever called from a gameplay path.
 * - The sim is a FIXED step with a CARRIED remainder, so a tumble is identical
 *   at 30, 60 and 144 fps and reproducible headless, where `dt` is clamped to
 *   0.05. Both halves are load-bearing and both have already been wrong once.
 * - Everything under it is COSMETIC. Nothing here feeds navigation, cover or
 *   hit detection, and nothing under it may ever decide anything — that rule
 *   outlived the fallbacks and is the one that has not moved.
 *
 * ## Why this is a system of its own
 *
 * It was `RagdollSystem`'s, privately, and two things made a second consumer
 * impossible rather than merely awkward. The step ran only while a corpse slot
 * was unfrozen, so a shard would have sat motionless whenever nobody was dying.
 * And the plugin was a private field, so the alternative was a second
 * `enablePhysics` on the same scene — which is not a second world, it is the
 * same one with two owners. (There was a third: the ragdoll SETTING tore the
 * static world down as a side effect, so glass would have fallen through the
 * floor for anyone who turned corpses off. That setting is gone with the
 * fallbacks it chose between, and the teardown it abused is now only the map's.)
 *
 * The split is the `BattleSystem`←`CombatSystem` precedent in `CLAUDE.md`:
 * INJECTED by `Game`, never imported system-to-system, and it is a constructor
 * argument rather than a callback because a client needs the plugin
 * synchronously while it is building bodies.
 *
 * ## Collision filtering
 *
 * Bit 0 is the world's. `RagdollSystem` takes bits 1..30, one per pooled corpse,
 * so a body does not collide with itself; `DEBRIS_GROUP` is bit 31's neighbour
 * and is shared by every shard. A client picking a group takes it from here, so
 * the whole allocation is readable in one place.
