/**
 * CombatSystem.ts — Hitscan for EVERYONE (player and bots share fire()), plus
 * pooled tracer/spark effects.
 * Invariants: fire() takes the shooter's target list — friendly fire is
 * excluded by the caller's list construction, never by a team check inside.
 * Wall ray filters OPAQUE_ONLY — the solid world minus what a round passes
 * through, which today is fence rails — and caps the shot; a target sphere
 * farther than the first opaque hit does not count (a bot embedded in a prop is
 * unshootable — movement bugs become combat bugs).
 * Damage is `damage` at close range falling to `opts.damageFar` past
 * `opts.falloffFar`, resolved against the distance the impact point already
 * cost — range is a slope now, and `range` is only where the ray stops.
 * The HEAD ZONE belongs to whoever passes `opts.headMult` > 1, which today is
 * the player and only the player: bots aim at `eyePos`, so a head sphere their
 * rounds could find would make every accurate bot shot a headshot. Below 1 the
 * sphere is never tested, so the bot path pays nothing for it. It is an
 * upgrade to a body hit that already landed, never a separate candidate — the
 * body sphere encloses it and it could not win a nearest-hit search.
 * Tracers/sparks/impact discs are
 * fixed-size pools: add new effects to a pool, NEVER allocate per shot.
 * The disc pool is `noGlow`, and that flag only works because `Game` builds
 * this system BEFORE its construction-time GlowLayer scan. Move the
 * construction later and every dust disc blooms like a lamp.
 * `metadata.surface` on the picked mesh chooses the impact; absent means
 * "hard", which is what every collider but the terrain floor's clone leaves.
 * A tracer is a short streak flown from muzzle to impact over several frames,
 * NOT a muzzle-to-impact beam — the hit is resolved instantly regardless, so
 * the flight is presentation only and must never gate damage. The impact spark
 * rides the streak and spawns on arrival: it is the one thing here that waits,
 * because an impact seen before its round lands is what makes a slowed tracer
 * read as fake.
