/**
 * DebrisSystem.ts — The glass a broken pane throws: a pool of thin rigid
 * bodies under `PhysicsWorld`, cut from the pane they came out of along the
 * cracks a round would have put in it.
 * Owns: the shard pool, its bodies and meshes, the per-size collision shapes,
 * and the burst's own clock. The crack pattern itself is
 * [`glassFracture.ts`](glassFracture.ts).
 * Invariants: it is the second `PhysicsClient` and owns no engine — see
 * `PhysicsWorld`. Nothing here feeds navigation, cover or hit detection: a shard
 * is dressing, exactly as a corpse is, and rounds and bodies pass through it.
 *
 * ## A shard is a fraction of its pane, not a fixed chip
 *
 * This threw twelve 16 cm chips into an 0.8 m cube at the crossing point, for
 * every pane on the map. Against a small punched window that reads; against a
 * shopfront bay it is the bug the whole system was built to avoid — a sheet of
 * glass several metres across vanishes in one frame and a handful of gravel
 * appears where the round went in, so the eye reads the pane as DELETED rather
 * than broken.
 *
 * So the burst is cut from the pane instead. `glass.shards` pieces are cut out
 * of the sheet's own face, laid out ON it, in its plane, before they are
 * thrown — at t=0 a burst is very nearly the sheet that was standing there,
 * which is what makes the next quarter second read as it coming apart.
 *
 * Where a pane is bigger than a burst — any kit that makes a whole glazed
 * elevation breakable in one piece — the pattern is centred on the hole and
 * clipped to the face rather than spread thin across it. That is the graceful
 * failure and it is deliberate: twelve pieces sprinkled over ninety square
 * metres is confetti, while twelve over the two metres around the round is a
 * hole with glass falling out of it. **The right fix for a pane that big is a
 * smaller pane** — see `kit/city.ts`, where the shopfront breaks a bay at a
 * time, the unit its own piers divide the elevation into.
 *
 * ## The pieces are CUT, and a cut is not a grid
 *
 * They were rectangles once, one size, square to the frame, in rows — the face
 * divided into cells of `sqrt(area / shards)` and a piece taken from each. Every
 * rule around it was already right and the shatter still read as a mosaic
 * sliding out of a wall, because glass does not break on a grid. It breaks from
 * the point the load went in, along radials out of the hole crossed by
 * concentric rings, and what falls out is wedges: narrow at the hole, broad at
 * the frame, no two alike. `glassFracture.fracture` is that pattern and this
 * file is what it costs — a piece is a convex polygon of up to `MAX_CORNERS`
 * corners, so a shard's MESH is written per burst rather than scaled.
 *
 * **The topology is fixed even though the outline is not**, which is what keeps
 * that affordable: every shard mesh is an eight-cornered prism built once, and
 * a piece with fewer corners repeats its last one so the spare triangles come
 * out degenerate — the same trick `GlassSystem.collapse` breaks a pane with. A
 * burst rewrites 48 vertices per shard into a buffer it already owns; it never
 * builds a mesh, an index buffer or a geometry.
 *
 * ## Which way the glass goes: the sheet's normal, the round's side
 *
 * A sheet leaves its frame along its own NORMAL, on the side the round was
 * going. The round drags glass along its own path only WITHIN the plane, where
 * its direction is projected. That is not just how a pane fails: it is what
 * keeps the pieces out of the frame they hung in and off the piers either side
 * of them.
 *
 * **The side needs no question asked of the pane, because every pane that
 * breaks is a way THROUGH** (see `PaneSpec.breakable`): there is a room behind
 * it, the shot has just opened it, and that is where the glass belongs. It was
 * a question once, when a city's decorative glazing broke too — a sheet hanging
 * 4 cm off a solid shaft had to throw its pieces back toward the SHOOTER, the
 * one side provably open, or Havok spent the first frames shoving bodies out of
 * the concrete they had been spawned inside. That glass no longer breaks, so
 * the case is gone rather than handled.
 *
 * ## Everything here is bounded, and each bound is a different thing
 *
 * **The POOL** is `glass.maxConcurrent` bursts of `glass.shards` bodies, built
 * once in the constructor and never rebuilt. At four and twelve that is 48
 * bodies, about five corpses — against eight corpses (80 bodies) measured at
 * 0.121 ms/frame, with the whole roster's AI at 0.39–0.42 ms in the same run.
 * The two are one budget and want raising together or not at all.
 *
 * **The DISTANCE** is `glass.shardDistance` and is deliberately not the fog wall
 * that gates a corpse. It is expressed for a piece of `shardMax` and scaled by
 * the pitch the pattern was cut at, because the question a gate answers is how
 * big the thing looks: a 16 cm chip is a pixel at sixty metres and a 0.9 m panel
 * is not. The BREAK is not gated by it: the pane goes at any range, because that
 * is the world changing rather than an effect playing.
 *
 * **The POOL EVICTS, but only what has already landed.** It used to refuse
 * outright, which is `GrenadeSystem`'s rule — but a refused burst is a window
 * that came out of a building with no glass in it, which is exactly the
 * mismatch above. `glass.shardSteal` is the compromise: a burst still in the
 * air is never stolen, because glass that vanishes mid-fall is worse than glass
 * that never flew, while one lying on the pavement is fair game.
 *
 * **There is no fallback and no reason for one.** Havok is required (see
 * `PhysicsWorld`) and the bodies are hung on the meshes in this constructor, so
 * a burst is either under the solver or is not drawn at all. What used to be
 * here was a scripted ballistic arc with the terrain as a floor, for the case
 * where a window broke before the WASM landed — a case that no longer exists,
 * carrying a second integrator and a terrain pointer for a fall nobody had
 * seen since the engine started shipping with the build.

   * so a window broken before the WASM landed still threw shards on a scripted
   * arc. The engine is up before this system is constructed now, so there is
   * one phase and a shard has a body from the moment it exists.
   *
   * It is still not built on the frame a window breaks: 48 meshes, their GL
   * buffers and their shapes are not a cost to pay on the frame somebody pulled
   * a trigger — `DeathCam`'s stand-in rig is built at `startRound` for the same
   * reason. What a burst DOES pay for on that frame is a `cut` per piece: a
   * rewrite of vertices the mesh already has, and never a geometry, an index
   * buffer or — once a size has been seen — a shape.
   *
   * **A shard's body is on the MESH, with no proxy node**, which is the one way
   * this is simpler than a corpse. A ragdoll needs proxies because Havok's sync
   * force-creates a `rotationQuaternion` on any node with a parent and the rig
   * is posed through Euler channels — but a shard is parented to nothing, is
   * posed by nobody, and is handed back to nothing. The quaternion Havok writes
   * is the only thing that ever orients it.
