/**
 * RagdollSystem.ts — Physics-driven deaths: a pool of corpses, and the hand-off
 * of a rig's joints to the solver and back.
 * Owns the pool, the bone bodies, the constraints and the proxies. It does NOT
 * own the engine — `PhysicsWorld` does, and hands it in — so this file no longer
 * names `@babylonjs/havok`, builds the static map, or steps anything. See that
 * file's header for why the split exists.
 *
 * It holds `RagdollSubject`s, not `Bot`s, and deliberately cannot tell the two
 * kinds apart: a bot killed in the fight and the stand-in body `DeathCam`
 * stands up where the player fell are the same thing to this file. Every rule
 * below applies to both, which is what stopped the player's corpse needing a
 * second copy of any of it.
 *
 * Invariants, each of which has a way of failing silently:
 * - Havok never touches a rig node. It writes POOL-OWNED PROXY nodes and the
 *   rig's joints are parented to those, because Havok's sync force-creates a
 *   `rotationQuaternion` on any node with a parent — and while one is set
 *   Babylon ignores `rotation`, which is what `animateSoldier` writes. One
 *   leaked quaternion is a bot frozen mid-tumble for the rest of the round.
 * - Nothing here feeds navigation, cover, or hit detection. A corpse is not in
 *   `NavGrid`, not in `ObstacleField`, not in `hittablesAgainst`. Bots walk
 *   through bodies and rounds pass through them, exactly as they did before
 *   this file existed. Do NOT "fix" that by feeding corpses into
 *   `ObstacleField` — its buckets are baked at map load for a reason.
 * - It is strictly cosmetic, and it is no longer optional. Havok is required
 *   (see `PhysicsWorld`), so the three refusals that were about the engine
 *   having arrived are gone along with the collapse tween that answered them.
 *   **What is left is ONE refusal: a death past `viewDistance`**, which is the
 *   fog wall, which is where the rig stops being drawn — so nothing the player
 *   can see is ever refused a fall. The pool being full is not a refusal any
 *   more either: `takeSlot` ends by evicting the OLDEST corpse, which was the
 *   death cam's exception and is now everyone's. See it for why that is safe.
 * - The sim is a FIXED step with a CARRIED remainder, so a tumble is identical
 *   at 30, 60 and 144 fps and reproducible headless, where `dt` is clamped to
 *   0.05. That clock is `PhysicsWorld`'s now; what stays here is the half that
 *   depends on it — `afterFirstStep` is this file's share of the teleport
 *   read-in, and it is per client precisely because each owns its own bodies.

   * hard enough to be killed is usually standing in exactly that. Measured at
