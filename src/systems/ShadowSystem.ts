/**
 * ShadowSystem.ts — Owns the moon's shadow camera and the contact shadows
 * under combatants.
 *
 * The DirectionalLight here is the scene's ONLY Babylon light, and it exists
 * purely to define the shadow frustum: no material reads scene lights (cel
 * materials carry their own uniforms, effect materials are unlit), so it
 * shades nothing directly. Its ShadowGenerator renders a depth map that the
 * cel fragment shader samples as a hard two-level shadow term.
 *
 * Casters are the merged static world meshes, re-registered via setCasters()
 * after every map build (the map is disposed and rebuilt per round).
 * Characters never cast into the map — the player rig is ~60 meshes and each
 * bot 9, so per-frame caster cost would dwarf the ~40 merged static draws.
 * They get blob shadows instead: soft unlit alpha discs that follow each
 * combatant (raycast to the ground for the airborne-capable player, the
 * nav-surface height for always-grounded bots).
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - The light position is snapped to the shadow map's texel grid as it
 *   tracks the player, so shadow edges stay rock steady instead of crawling.
 * - The depth map re-renders only when the snapped focus moves.
 * - The depth pass draws only the casters standing in the window (see
 *   getCustomRenderList) — Babylon culls nothing off an explicit renderList.
 * - Meshes with metadata.noShadowCaster (flat ground sheets, roads) must
 *   never be registered — they are receivers, and casting from them is acne.
 * - Blob discs are isPickable=false, metadata.noOutline, and never casters.
 * - updateBlobs takes the player's ground height rather than probing for it:
 *   Player.floorY is that number, already found this frame.

   * constraint is therefore a function of the map's hour: at Hollowmere's 38
   * degrees the two are close, and at a low sun the along-sun reach comes for
   * free while the across-sun reach is all this buys.
   *
   * So a map that lowers its sun raises this to match, and there is a ceiling
   * past which it buys nothing: the depth volume reaches `shadowMaxZ` either
   * side of the light camera, which lands on the ground along the sun as
   * `2 * halfDepth / cos(elevation)`. With the shipped `distance` 90 and
   * `depthRange` 180 that half-depth is 89.5 m, so at 24 degrees the along-sun
   * reach is +/-98 m and matching it across-sun wants ~196. Widening
   * `depthRange` to push past that is not free: `shadowParams.x` is a
   * NORMALISED bias, so a deeper volume rescales what it means in metres and
   * the failure is peter-panning at the foot of a wall.
   *
   * Invalidating the snapped focus is not optional. The texel quantum is

   * rounded to, and a focus still snapped to the old quantum is stale — which
   * shows up as the crawling edges the snapping exists to prevent.
