/**
 * BattleSystem.ts — Bot roster: a fixed pool built once and NEVER disposed
 * (death hides a rig, respawn re-poses it — respawning is continuous), AI
 * scheduling, LOS, distance LOD.
 * Invariants: think ticks are staggered round-robin at CONFIG.bots.thinkRate,
 * and a dead bot must not consume a budget slot or the living think slower than
 * advertised. Target acquisition ray-tests candidates nearest-first, stops at
 * the first visible one, and is capped at CONFIG.bots.acquireRayBudget — the
 * view cone (Bot.facing) rejects most candidates before any ray is fired.
 * Hearing, damage direction and near-miss suppression are all RAY-FREE by
 * construction; keep them that way — as is everything a team tells itself
 * (SquadRadio: one per team, held here, cleared on reset, and reached by bots
 * only through BattleCtx). A call and a hazard mark are CUES: they seed
 * BotMemory and may never hand anybody a target.
 * LOS rays filter OPAQUE_ONLY, so a bot sees through what it could shoot
 * through (fence rails) and not through what it could not.
 * Cover is a baked lookup (world/CoverMap), never a probe. Bot muzzle flashes are
 * NOT pulsed from here — this system only records flash positions and Game
 * spends CONFIG.lighting.muzzleBudgetPerFrame on the nearest few (16 shader
 * light slots are absolute). Runs AFTER ConquestSystem.update each frame.
 * Cross-system effects go out via onBotKill/onBotFired callbacks wired in
 * Game — never import other systems. A bot's grenade leaves the same way
 * (throwGrenadeFor): the ballistics and the pool are GrenadeSystem's, and this
 * file only forwards the bot's ask and its answer.
 * Non-bot combatants live in `humans` (one offline, up to sixteen on the
 * server) and must be visible to hittablesAgainst and acquire, or bots shoot
 * through people. Bots whose roster slot a human has taken are BENCHED: not
 * respawned, not thought for, not shootable, not drawn — and un-benching drops
 * them back into the ordinary respawn queue with skill and squad intact, which
 * is what makes a human joining and leaving symmetrical. Every loop over
 * `bots` must skip the bench; `Bot` itself knows nothing about any of it.
 * A HUMAN ALWAYS HOLDS A SLOT, offline as well as on the server: `seatPlayer`
 * benches the local player's, which is what makes a single-player round 8v8
 * rather than 8v9.

 * Owns both teams: a fixed pool of bot rigs, the AI schedule, and the render
 * LOD that makes sixteen of them affordable.
 *
 * Three decisions carry the frame budget here:
 *
 * 1. **The pool is built once and never disposed.** `new Bot()` allocates a
 *    dozen Babylon meshes and their GL buffers; in a roguelike that cost landed
 *    twelve times per room load, but Conquest respawns continuously and it
 *    would be a permanent source of frame spikes. Death hides a rig, respawn
 *    re-poses and re-shows it.
 * 2. **AI is staggered.** Target acquisition and line-of-sight rays run at
 *    `CONFIG.bots.thinkRate` per bot, round-robin across frames — about three
 *    ray picks per frame for the whole roster. Movement still integrates every
 *    frame, so nothing looks choppy.
 * 3. **Distance LOD.** Past the fog the rig is disabled outright; past
 *    `lodFreezeDistance` the pose freezes but the bot keeps walking; past
 *    `lodOutlineDistance` the outline pass is skipped, halving its draw calls.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* here: a spatial hash. With 17 combatants the pairwise
 * separation pass is ~256 distance checks a frame, which is far cheaper than
 * maintaining buckets. Revisit it if the roster grows past ~64 — four times
 * what it is now, so this has room. (Both figures were written for a 16v16
 * roster and outlived it; `bots.perTeam` is 8.)
