/**
 * CaptureZoneSystem.ts — In-world markers for the Conquest control points: a
 * terrain-following ring drawn ON the capture boundary, a skirt that rises
 * from the stretch of it you are about to cross, and a tall beacon over the
 * flag itself.
 *
 * Invariants: this is annotation geometry and nothing else — never
 * `metadata.solid`, never `checkCollisions`, never pickable, and never a
 * WorldBox, so no ray test (hitscan, LOS, ground probe) and no nav consumer
 * can see it. Every mesh sets noOutline/noGlow/noShadowCaster AND calls
 * `glow.addExcludedMesh` by hand: Game's GlowLayer exclusion scan runs once at
 * construction, so nothing built later is picked up by it (same reason
 * WaterSystem and the editor proxies exclude their own meshes).
 *
 * The ring's radius IS the capture radius — both this and
 * `ConquestSystem.pointAt` read `ControlPointDef.radius`, so the line you see
 * is the line the occupancy test uses. Colours are the HUD/minimap ones and
 * are relative to the player's team, not absolute per side.
 *
 * Never imports ConquestSystem: `update` takes the flag state structurally
 * (`ZoneState`), which `ControlPoint` satisfies, so Game can pass its points
 * straight through without this becoming a system-to-system import.
 *
 * build() once per round; update() every frame AFTER the camera has moved —
 * both the fog fade and the skirt's reveal are functions of the viewpoint.
