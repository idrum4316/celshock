 * magnetism (pulling toward its centre).
 * Invariants: NEVER affects mouse/keyboard — it disengages the moment the
 * mouse moves and leaves mouse sensitivity untouched. Its rotation is capped
 * at a fraction of the player's OWN full-stick turn rate, is gated on the
 * player actually driving, and is cancelled by opposing stick deflection — so
 * a committed push always wins. LOS ray filters metadata.solid === true (walls
 * block assist). Called by Game before CameraSystem.update.

 * Gamepad aim assist, in the console-shooter lineage: target friction plus a
 * rotational term. See `CONFIG.aimAssist` for what each number means and for
 * the three invariants that keep it from reading as auto-aim.
 *
 * The rotation is two terms with very different jobs:
 *
 * - **Tracking (adhesion)** follows motion. Each frame the target's direction
 *   from the eye has moved by some angle; the assist gives back a share of
 *   it, so a strafing enemy drags the reticle along instead of sliding out
 *   from under it. It is a *delta*, not a rate, so it is frame rate
 *   independent by construction and needs no dt. Crucially it is zero
 *   against a stationary target — it can help you hold an aim, never take
 *   one.
 * - **Magnetism** recovers error. A pull toward the target's centre,
 *   strongest at the rim of the inner bubble and zero inside
 *   `magnetDeadzone` of it, so it closes a near miss onto the body and lets
 *   go.
 *
 * They divide the work by where the reticle is rather than by size: near the
 * centre tracking is all there is, and near the rim magnetism is deliberately
 * the larger of the two, because that is the term whose job is to get back.
 * Measured against a bot strafing at 4 m/s across 15 m with the trigger held,
 * the pair settles ~0.035 rad off its centre and holds there — the reticle
 * stays with the target, roughly two body-widths behind the middle of it. The
 * assist keeps you in the fight; the last correction is still the player's.
 *
 * Tracking is split by cause — the target moving versus the player strafing
 * around it — because compensating the player's own motion is the half that
 * feels like the game is playing for you, so it is scaled down separately
 * (`selfMotionMult`).
 *
 * Keyboard/mouse is unaffected by construction: the whole system returns null
 * unless a gamepad is connected AND the pad produced the most recent input
 * activity, so a single mouse movement disengages it the same frame — and
 * even while engaged, the slowdown is only ever multiplied into the stick
 * terms of the camera update.
 *
 * Costs at most one ray pick per frame: candidates are filtered by angle
 * first, and only the winner is tested against `solid` colliders — the same
 * pick hitscan uses, so the assist never pulls through a wall.
