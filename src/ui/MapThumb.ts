/**
 * MapThumb.ts — The top-down schematic of a map, drawn from its LAYOUT rather
 * than from a built world.
 * Owns: the canvas painting behind the menu's map row and nothing else. Takes
 * a `MapDef` and a 2D context; holds no state, keeps no cache, and is called
 * again whenever the row changes.
 * Invariants: it reads a map's layout DATA ONLY — the heightfield, the water
 * rects, the scatter regions, the placements' positions, the control points
 * and the spawns. It never touches `GameMap`, `MapBuilder` or the scene.
 *
 * That restriction is the whole reason this file can exist. The deploy screen
 * draws its map out of the finished collider set, which is the honest way to
 * draw a map you are standing in — the two can never disagree — but it needs a
 * BUILT map, and the main menu is the one screen in the game where there is no
 * such thing: on a cold boot nothing has been built yet, and building one to
 * illustrate a row costs the ~0.7 s the building card exists to cover. Every
 * field this reads is a module constant that was in the bundle before the
 * player pressed anything.
 *
 * So it is a SCHEMATIC and is drawn as one — a relief, some water, the blocks
 * of dressing, a scatter of footprints, and the five flags lettered. It is not
 * claiming to be the map, and the one thing it must never do is imply a
 * fidelity it does not have: no building outlines (a placement is a point and
 * a kit name, not a footprint), no roads (they are visual-only and not in the
 * layout as shapes), no rim.
 *
 * The palette is the MAP'S OWN, out of its `EnvironmentSpec`. A night village,
 * a jungle morning and a city at dusk get three different-coloured thumbnails
 * for free, and a fourth map is coloured by the environment it ships with
 * rather than by a table here that somebody has to remember to extend.
