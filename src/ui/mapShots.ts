/**
 * mapShots.ts — The photograph of each map that stands behind the main menu,
 * and the camera position it was taken from.
 * Owns: the shot table — one image per map id, plus the VANTAGE that image is
 * a picture of. Holds no state and draws nothing; `OverlayScreen` reads the
 * url and `scripts/capture-map-shots.mjs` reads the vantage.
 * Invariants: a map with no row here is not a broken screen — the menu falls
 * back to its veil over the live scene, exactly as it looked before there were
 * shots at all. Never import this from anything but the menu: the images are
 * ~250 KB each and nothing else on any screen wants them.
 *
 * **The vantage lives here, beside the image, because it is the only thing
 * that can regenerate it.** A screenshot is an opaque 200 KB rectangle: there
 * is nothing in the file that says where the camera stood, so a map whose
 * chapel moves has a backdrop nobody can retake without guessing. Stating the
 * pose next to the picture makes `npm run shots` a re-run rather than a
 * re-hunt, and makes a re-frame a two-number edit.
 *
 * **Which is why this is a UI table and not a field on `MapDef`.** A map's
 * `blurb` is on the map because a map's own file is the only place that cannot
 * fall out of step with it — but a `MapDef` is imported by the SERVER
 * (`Match.ts`, `simulate.ts`), which has no screen, no menu and no use for a
 * quarter of a megabyte of JPEG per map. The menu's backdrop is the menu's.
 * What that costs is the one thing this file must therefore say out loud: a
 * fourth map added to `world/maps.ts` gets no backdrop until it is given a row
 * here, and the menu will not complain, it will simply look like it used to.
 *
 * The images are imported with Vite's `?url`, the same way `WaterSystem` takes
 * its water textures — so they are content-hashed into `dist/assets/`, they
 * are precached by the service worker along with everything else the build
 * emitted, and a re-shoot invalidates its own url without anybody editing a
 * cache list.
