 * SettingsScreen.ts — The settings screen: a list of choices over a scrim, split

 * Owns #settings and its own page and row selection; owns no setting, and
 * applies nothing — every change leaves through `onChange` and comes back as a
 * `setValues` from Game, so the screen can never disagree with what is stored.
 * Invariants: the rows are DATA (`PAGES`), never markup — this screen exists to
 * grow, and a hardcoded row is a row the keyboard navigation does not know
 * about. Every row is one CHOICE over a list of options, whatever it is drawn
 * as: `style` picks the button group or the slider and changes nothing below
 * the markup (see `ControlRow`), and the page selector is a row of that same
 * shape so that switching page needs no key the screen did not already read.
 * Above #loadout's z-index, because it is reachable from the pause lid and has
 * to cover everything the pause card sits over.

/**
 * One line on the screen: a labelled CHOICE bound to one field of `Settings`.
 *
 * **A toggle is a two-option choice, which is why there is only one control
 * type here rather than two.** The markup was already an N-button group with
 * Off and On in it, so an enumeration needed no second renderer, no second
 * key handler and no second hit-testing path — only a longer list.
 *
 * **`style` is where a longer list stops fitting, and it is a rendering choice
 * over the SAME options.** The control column is fixed — three rungs is ~60 px a
 * button and sixteen is 10 px, narrower than one character of a letterspaced
 * 10 px face — so a row whose options run past a handful draws as a slider
 * instead: a track the whole list is laid along, a thumb at the current rung and
 * the value beside it.
 *
 * **The slider is positioned by INDEX, not by value, and that is what keeps it
 * a choice over `options` rather than a second kind of setting.** The thumb
 * travels one option per equal share of the track, so what the store holds is
 * always a member of the same table the arrow keys step through, the same table
 * a codec in [`settings.ts`](../core/settings.ts) validates against — a drag
 * cannot land on a value a keypress could not reach, and nothing downstream
 * learns that the row looks different. It also means a ladder with deliberate
 * spacing keeps it: `CONFIG.camera.lookScales` is geometric, so an inch of drag
 * is the same RATIO of look speed wherever on the track it is taken.
 *
 * `ControlRow` is generic over the key so each row's options are typed against
 * that key's own value; `AnyControl` distributes it into a union, which is what
 * stops `renderScale` being given `true`. The pairing is enforced HERE, in the
 * table, because it cannot be at the callback: `onChange` has to be one
 * function over every key.
