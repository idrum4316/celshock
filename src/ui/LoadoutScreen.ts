/**
 * LoadoutScreen.ts — The kit screen: pick a weapon, fit an optic, paint the
 * thing, turn it over in your hands, and read what the trade costs.
 * Owns: its own DOM under `#hud`, the three-slot selection model, the stat
 * table it derives from `CONFIG.weapons`, and the pointer drags over its
 * stage. It reports choices and redraws nothing on its own — `Game` applies a
 * pick and calls `setFit` back, so the highlighted button can never get ahead
 * of the weapon in the player's hands.
 *
 * The weapon on the right is not a picture: it is the real viewmodel, the one
 * that will be in the player's hands, posed on a turntable by `ViewModel` and
 * drawn by the live scene behind this overlay. Two consequences run through
 * the file:
 * - **The stage is a hole in the scrim, not a panel.** The weapon is on the
 *   canvas and every part of this screen is above it, so the stage half carries
 *   no background of its own — only a vignette to frame it. Which is also why
 *   `show()` marks `#hud` and the CSS hides the menu and the deploy map while
 *   the kit is up: they are DOM too, and either would paint over the weapon.
 * - **The stage's geometry is shared with `CONFIG.viewmodel.inspect`.** The
 *   panel column's width is what puts the stage's centre 0.46 of the way
 *   across the viewport, which is the anchor the weapon is placed at. Both
 *   sides are fractions of the viewport, so a resize moves them together.
 *
 * **The FINISH row is the one that is not a trade**, and it is drawn like the
 * other two anyway. Every other choice on this screen costs something — a
 * magnification is a field of view, a weapon is a rate against a magazine —
 * and a finish costs nothing at all, so it has no bar on the chart and never
 * touches one. What it has instead is the STAGE: it is the only pick here
 * whose whole effect is the thing already turning on the turntable, which is
 * why its copy is written under the weapon rather than beside the bars, and
 * why its buttons carry a swatch. A row of names for fifteen colour schemes
 * would be a row you have to try one at a time.
 *
 * The four on offer are the CARRIED weapon's own — the standard finish plus
 * three nothing else is offered, which `FINISHES_BY_WEAPON` decides — so this
 * row is rebuilt when the weapon row moves, exactly as the chart and the blurb
 * are.
 *
 * A screen rather than a row, because there are three slots now and the row it
 * replaces was a strip of buttons wedged under a menu that already had a
 * difficulty picker on it. It is reachable from the MAIN MENU and from the
 * DEPLOY screen, and deliberately not from the pause menu: a round you are
 * already standing in is not somewhere you get to change what you are
 * carrying. Nothing enforces that with a flag; the states that can open it are
 * the states that offer the button.
 *
 * The stat bars are DERIVED from the weapon table rather than authored. Each
 * one is that weapon's number against the best number any weapon has, so a
 * third weapon added to CONFIG re-scales the chart instead of dating it.
 *
 * "Any weapon" means `PRIMARY_WEAPON_IDS` throughout — the sidearm is in the
 * same table and is not a choice, so it appears on neither the buttons nor the
 * scale. Ranking against a weapon nobody can decline would shrink every bar on
 * the screen to say something the player cannot act on.
 *
 * CSS contract: `#hud` is `pointer-events: none`, so this overlay opts back in
 * — the same carve-out `#deploy` takes.
