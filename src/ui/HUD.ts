/**
 * HUD.ts — The gameplay chrome, and only that: vitals/ammo/grenades, the stowed
 * slot, reinforcement gauge, flag strip, capture-zone panel, crosshair,
 * hitmarker, damage vignette, directional damage arcs, toasts, killfeed,
 * score feed, scoreboard.
 * Invariants: Game pushes state every frame (setHealth/setAmmo/setFlags/
 * setCapture/setViewYaw/...) — setting HUD state from anywhere else is
 * overwritten next tick. Pure DOM manipulation; reads ControlPoint data, never
 * imports game systems beyond types. Transient elements (toasts, killfeed)
 * self-remove via setTimeout; the damage arcs are a fixed pool, never allocated
 * per hit.
 *
 * The menu, the round-over card and the pause list are NOT here — they are
 * `OverlayScreen`, a peer of DeployScreen and LoadoutScreen. This file was both
 * for a long time, which is why every new screen grew it. What stays is the two
 * class toggles that hide the HUD's OWN chrome while something covers it,
 * `setPaused` and `setEditing`; `.overlaid` went with the cards that raise it.
 *
 * Per-frame writes touch text nodes, class flags and CSS custom properties
 * only — never innerHTML. Every element written 60 times a second (the ticket
 * gauge, the flag cells, the magazine strip) is built once and cached, and
 * `setScoreboard` is the one markup-rebuilding call left.
 *
 * **EVERY SETTER GUARDS ITS OWN WRITE.** `Game.updateHud` pushes the whole
 * gauge set on every frame — that is the right shape, and it says nothing
 * about how often the DOM should hear it. Health moves on a hit, tickets a few
 * times a second, the flag strip on a capture, and the scoreboard's markup only
 * while Tab is held. So each setter keeps the value it last handed over and
 * writes only on a difference; `setFps` is the pattern, and the `last*` block
 * of fields below is the bookkeeping. Adding a setter here without a guard is
 * adding a style recalculation to every frame of the game.

   * strip on a change of magazine size, the grenade pips on a change of pouch,
   * the flag cells on a change of flag count, and the scoreboard's key when the
