/**
 * TouchControls.ts — the on-screen controls a phone plays with: a floating
 * movement stick in the left zone, a free-look drag in the right one, and the
 * button cluster over both.
 * Owns: `#touch` and every finger that lands on it — the pointer-id bookkeeping,
 * the stick's origin, the ADS and scoreboard latches, and the look delta it
 * hands over consume-on-read. Owns NO game state: it is polled by
 * `InputManager` exactly as a gamepad is, and the two things it draws that it
 * cannot know (whether the body is crouched, whether the magazine is out) are
 * PUSHED by `Game` like every other HUD gauge.
 *
 * Invariants: `consume()` must be called exactly once per frame — it zeroes the
 * look accumulator and spends the one-frame floor under a tap. Every listener
 * calls `preventDefault`, which is what stops a tap on the fire button arriving
 * a moment later as a synthesized `mousedown` and convincing `InputManager`
 * that a mouse turned up. It never assigns `InputManager`'s fields directly and
 * never imports a system; `Game` wires it, and the pause button is a callback
 * out, never a state change taken here.
 *
 * WHY THE SHAPE IS WHAT IT IS. Every decision here is the one both Call of Duty
 * Mobile and Delta Force Mobile made, because the ergonomics are not a matter of
 * taste — two thumbs have to cover four jobs:
 *
 * - **The stick FLOATS.** Its ring is born wherever the thumb lands in the left
 *   zone rather than sitting in a fixed corner, so it is in the right place on
 *   every screen size and under every grip, and the thumb never has to look for
 *   it. It is also forgiving: a thumb that drags past the radius pulls the
 *   origin along instead of pinning at full deflection, so pulling back
 *   responds at once rather than after the slack is taken up.
 * - **Sprint comes off the stick, not off a button** (CoD Mobile's "Joystick
 *   Sprint"): pushing to the rim runs. A button would cost a press with a thumb
 *   that is already busy, and there is no room for another one anyway.
 * - **The look is a DRAG, not a second stick.** A drag anywhere in the right
 *   zone turns the view, which is what makes a flick behind you one gesture.
 * - **The fire button steers.** Pressing it claims the finger AND starts a look
 *   drag, so the right thumb can hold the trigger and keep aiming — CoD Mobile
 *   ships this as the non-"Fixed R-Fire Button" behaviour, and without it the
 *   right thumb has to choose between shooting and looking, which is the single
 *   thing that makes a touch shooter unplayable. The second, smaller fire
 *   button on the left is for the claw grip, where a left finger shoots and the
 *   right thumb does nothing but aim.
 * - **ADS and the scoreboard LATCH; crouch does not.** A hold costs a thumb the
 *   player does not have, so tapping aims and tapping again lowers. Crouch is
 *   the exception because it must not own a second latch: `InputManager` already
 *   holds one for `C` and the pad's B, and this button flips that one on its
 *   rising edge exactly as they do. Which is also why the crouched LOOK of the
 *   button is pushed in rather than known here.
