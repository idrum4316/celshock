/**
 * The bot soldier rig: a humanoid built to be cheap enough to draw sixteen
 * of at once, and detailed enough to be read as a soldier at the range one is
 * usually shot at.
 *
 * Every limb is built from several boxes and then **merged into one mesh per
 * colour**, the same trick `RifleModel.buildRifle` uses to collapse ~50 boxes
 * into 3. The joints stay as `TransformNode`s above the merged meshes, so
 * procedural animation is unaffected — only the leaf geometry is batched.
 *
 * **What that merge means for anyone adding detail: geometry is nearly free and
 * PAINT is not.** Forty-odd boxes come out as nineteen meshes — torso (shell,
 * webbing, accent), head (shell, webbing, neck, accent, visor), two arms (suit,
 * accent), two legs (thigh, shin, boot) and the rifle — because a segment pays
 * per colour in it and not per box. The outline pass draws each of those twice
 * and a Conquest roster is sixteen bodies, so one more colour on a segment is
 * ~32 draw calls and one more box in a colour that segment already has is none.
 * Pouches, a bedroll, a kneepad and an antenna are all in the second category
 * on purpose; the helmet band is the only thing here that was worth paying a
 * mesh for, and it is paid because the head is what peeks over cover.
 *
 * The player has no rig at all — the camera is inside the head, and there is no
 * own-body to draw. The one thing that stands a player's body up is the death
 * cam, and it builds one of these.

 * What one side is DRAWN in: three cel colours of its own, the two the team

 * gone from either side of a body, and gone from every side of one far enough
 * away for a 0.1 m stripe to fall under a pixel. What was left telling the
 * sides apart in both cases was the visor's glow and nothing else. The three
 * answers here are stacked deliberately, because each covers where the one
 * before it fails:
 *
 * - **Hue.** A whole kit that is warm (Valeguard: khaki plate, brown canvas)
 *   or cold (Redline: slate plate, blue-black suit). It costs NOTHING — the
 *   same boxes in different paint — and it is the only one of the three that
 *   still works on a body three pixels wide, because it is the average of every
 *   one of those pixels rather than a feature inside them.
 * - **Accent.** `CONFIG.teams[].color` on the pauldrons, the bandolier and the
 *   helmet band — the one saturated colour on the model, placed so that some of
 *   it faces every direction: the shoulders from the sides and from above, the
 *   bandolier from front and back, the band on the head that clears cover
 *   first.
 * - **Silhouette.** `face` gives each side its own head against the sky, which
 *   is what is left when a body is backlit, in Greyfen's mist or in a night
 *   village where the whole model is one value. It is the only read that
 *   survives with no colour at all.
 *
 * **The accent and the visor are READ from `CONFIG.teams` rather than written
 * here**, because the friend/foe colour is a rule the deploy map, the flag
 * markers and the killfeed all share: a soldier painted in a fifth colour of
 * its own would be the one body on the field wearing the wrong side's marker.
 * The other three are ART and live here for the reason `RAGDOLL_BONES` does —
 * they belong with the box lists they are painted onto.

 * refused a body caught mid-crouch outright and the tween took it, which meant
 * the one stance a player holds while being shot at was also the one stance

 * finger — so the weapon would fall away while two fists stayed cupped around
