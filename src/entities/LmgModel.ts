/**
 * Builds a low-poly cel-styled belt-fed light machine gun. Local +z is the
 * barrel axis, origin at the receiver centre — the same frame the other four
 * weapons are built in, so the viewmodel poses any of them with the same
 * numbers.
 *
 * **The argument is the ammunition, and this is the one weapon here that shows
 * you its own.** The other four keep every round they have inside a box you
 * cannot see into; this one carries a belt up the outside of the receiver in
 * plain sight, which is why `weaponKit` grew a brass colour group that is
 * empty on all four of them. Everything else about the silhouette is that belt
 * being fed, housed and paid for:
 *
 * - **The feed cover and the split rail.** A belt is loaded from above, so the
 *   whole top of the receiver is a hinged lid — long, flat, latched at the
 *   back, and carrying the rail on its own top face. It stops where the cover
 *   stops, and the gap between it and the front sight tower is the honest read
 *   of a weapon whose barrel comes off: nothing that is lifted away mid-fight
 *   is allowed to carry the optic. The tower bridges it at exactly `RAIL_TOP`
 *   and no higher, which is `RAIL_REACH` in `optics.ts` — nothing forward of
 *   the mount may stand above the rail without sitting in the middle of the
 *   scope's picture.
 * - **The box under the receiver.** Where every other weapon here has a
 *   magazine, this has a square container as wide as the receiver and half its
 *   depth again, which is what makes the weapon bottom-heavy from any angle —
 *   the fastest way to tell it from the rifle at a glance is that the mass is
 *   under the bore rather than over it.
 * - **The belt itself.** Six rounds and their links, standing proud of the
 *   LEFT flank between the box's chute and the feed tray's lip — the flank the
 *   camera actually sees, since the weapon is held to the right of the lens.
 *   The rounds are pins ACROSS the weapon, so what shows is a stack of case
 *   heads, which is what a belt looks like from the side it is fed from.
 * - **The side-folding carry handle.** A machine gun's handle is on top of the
 *   barrel, and on top of the barrel is precisely where `RAIL_REACH` forbids
 *   it — the same rule that cost the carbine its handle bridge. So it is
 *   hinged at the front and folded back down the barrel's left flank, under
 *   the sight line, where it doubles as the second horizontal line the eye
 *   reads the weapon's length along.
 * - **The bipod, folded back under the barrel.** Legs along the underside with
 *   the feet trailing, rather than the carbine's pair lying in flank recesses:
 *   this is a weapon that is MEANT to be put down, and the legs are stowed the
 *   way something used every time it stops is stowed.
 *
 * Three smaller things finish it: a heavy fluted barrel with a gas regulator
 * under the block (the one part of any weapon here that exists to be turned
 * mid-fight), a charging handle on the RIGHT — every other long gun charges on
 * the left, and the left flank of this one is already carrying a belt and a
 * handle — and a flared conical flash hider against the rifle's birdcage, the
 * carbine's rings and the DMR's chambered brake.
 *
 * ~140 parts, merged to one mesh per colour. The merge is what makes the
 * detail free and what keeps the outline pass drawing one border per colour
 * group instead of a black shell around every rib.
