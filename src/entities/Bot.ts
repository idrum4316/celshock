/**
 * Bot.ts — AI combatant: FSM (advance/hunt/engage/takeCover/suppressed/retreat/
 * capture/dead), movement, perception, aiming, firing. Rig visuals come from
 * SoldierModel.
 * Invariants: NEVER uses moveWithCollisions and never runs its own pathfinding —
 * movement steers on NavGrid flow fields + ObstacleField push-out. Think ticks
 * (target acquisition, FSM transitions) are rate-limited and staggered by
 * BattleSystem; update() (movement/animation) runs every frame. Bots hold a
 * target until it dies/breaks LOS/leaves range — removing that hysteresis
 * makes bots never fire, which is also why `aimT` resets ONLY on a genuine
 * target change and a remembered enemy is re-acquired at `reacquireDelay`
 * rather than from zero. Aim is a LAGGING point, never the target's exact eye
 * position: that is what makes strafing work. Obstacle push-out is a
 * preference, not a veto: squeezeT drops it when wedged. Bots are pooled by
 * BattleSystem — death hides the rig, respawn re-poses it; never allocate a new
 * Bot per respawn. Animation is procedural and the ONE stance an AI decides is
 * the crouch: `wantCrouch` is the decision, `crouchBlend` the eased result, and
 * everything downstream — the eye, the hit sphere, the pose, the speed and the
 * spread — reads the BLEND, so a stance caught halfway is as correct as one at
 * rest. The eye and the hit sphere come down TOGETHER (see `syncTransform`) or
 * crouching makes a body easier to kill rather than harder. There is still no
 * lean and no flinch pose. Cover is a KIND and not a flag: `hard` is stood
 * behind and stepped out of, `crouch` is ducked behind and stood up out of, and
 * the peek cycle is the same clock either way.
 * `yaw` is where the bot LOOKS (and is what the view cone reads);
 * `bodyYaw` is where its feet point. Keeping them apart is what stops a
 * strafing bot walking sideways, and the twist between them is clamped. Cover is a PREFERENCE: a spot that cannot be reached inside
 * cover.abandonTime is dropped (with a cooldown, or the search instantly
 * re-picks it) and the bot fights from where it stands. A bot moving to cover
 * still shoots; only the tucked-in half of the peek cycle holds fire.
 * What a bot hears from its own side is a CUE and never knowledge. Both live on
 * the team's `SquadRadio` and are reached only through `BattleCtx`, and neither
 * is allowed into `BotMemory`, because everything in there feeds `hasCue` and
 * would turn a cue into a SEARCH: a contact call is a LOOK (the cone and the
 * head, nothing else) and a hazard mark is where this team keeps dying, which
 * bends an approach and never aims a rifle.
 * Grenades are two a life, considered on the ordinary think tick against a
 * target the bot already has, and never thrown inside `grenade.bot.minRange` —
 * that band IS the self-preservation, since there is no self-damage to teach
 * one and no rig pose that could sell taking cover from your own frag.
 * New behavior = new FSM state, never new clips.
