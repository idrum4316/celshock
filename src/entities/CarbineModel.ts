 * are built in, so the viewmodel poses any of them with the same numbers.
 *
 * **The layout is the argument, and it is the one thing the other three cannot
 * say.** They are all the same weapon at three sizes: a receiver, a magazine
 * under it, a grip behind that, a stock behind that. This one folds the action
 * into the stock and puts the magazine BEHIND the firing hand, which changes
 * every line on it at once — the grip stands alone at the front with nothing
 * under the barrel, the magazine is a block against the shoulder, the trigger
 * reaches its own mechanism through a linkage bar down the side, the brass
 * leaves at the cheek, and the top is one flat plane from butt pad to gas
 * block with no cheek riser, no folding hinge and no separate stock on it.
 * A player who cannot read a stat chart can tell it from the rifle in the dark.
 *
 * **The silhouette is the FAMAS's, and three features carry it**, each of them
 * something no other weapon in the kit has any reason to grow:
 *
 * - **The carry-handle blade.** A slab standing the full depth from the barrel
 *   to the underside of the rail, running from the receiver to a raked strut
 *   that drops onto the gas block — so the weapon is solid where every other
 *   one here is open, and the triangle of daylight under that strut is the one
 *   hole in it. It is also the whole of what the real handle can be: an optic's
 *   view cone spreads with distance and `RAIL_REACH` in `optics.ts` is the rule
 *   that falls out of it, so **nothing forward of the mount may stand above
 *   `RAIL_TOP`** — a bridge over the top would sit squarely in the middle of
 *   the scope's picture. The handle is therefore cut off at the sight line and
 *   the rail is its top face, which is exactly what the modern flat-top variant
 *   of this weapon did for the same reason.
 * - **The full-hand trigger guard.** A polymer loop from the grip's toe forward
 *   and up into the handguard, big enough for a gloved fist rather than a
 *   finger, and open at the sides so the hand shows through it. It is the one
 *   part of any weapon here that is drawn AROUND the viewmodel's own glove.
 * - **The folded bipod.** Two legs lying in a recess down the flanks of the
 *   handguard, hinged forward with the feet pointing back — which is what this
 *   weapon carries instead of the vertical foregrip a fourth model would
 *   otherwise have grown, and instead of the accessory rails the other three
 *   already wear.
 *
 * Three smaller things finish it: a long ringed muzzle with a bayonet lug under
 * it (against the round cages the rifle and SMG end in and the chambered brake
 * on the DMR), a butt whose underside rakes up to a short pad, and the
 * three-position selector standing where the thumb falls, which is the fire
 * mode itself made visible.
 *
 * ~120 parts, merged to one mesh per colour. The merge is what makes the
 * detail free and what keeps the outline pass drawing one border per colour
 * group instead of a black shell around every rib.
