/**
 * NetSoldier.ts — Somebody else, drawn from the wire.
 * Owns: one `SoldierRig`, the interpolation buffer behind it, and the pose it
 * is put into each frame. Owns NO behaviour: it never thinks, never moves
 * itself, never fires, and never decides it is dead. Everything it shows was
 * decided by the authority.
 * Invariants: a `Combatant`, so `ConquestSystem`, `Minimap` and `ShadowSystem`
 * take it exactly as they take a `Bot`. It is pooled and never disposed — the
 * same rule the bot pool follows and for the same reason, since respawning is
 * continuous. It must never be given a `BattleCtx`; if it ever needs one,
 * something has put AI back on the client.
 *
 * **A bot and a remote human are the same thing here, and that is the point.**
 * The server decides which roster slots are people and which are AI; a client
 * draws sixteen of these either way and never learns the difference. That is
 * what makes "start a match without a full lobby" and "give a leaver's slot
 * back to a bot" the same mechanism instead of two, and it is why there is no
 * spawn or despawn on this path at all — a slot only ever changes who feeds it.
 *
 * Interpolation runs `CONFIG.net.interpDelay` behind the newest snapshot, so
 * every frame is drawn between two samples that have actually arrived. That
 * costs a fixed, honest latency and buys immunity from jitter; extrapolating
 * instead would be smoother on a clean connection and would invent motion that
 * never happened on a bad one.
