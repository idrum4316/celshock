/**
 * optics.ts — The three fittable sights, built onto whatever weapon asked for
 * them.
 * Owns: the geometry of the irons, the holo and the scope, and the eye
 * reference each one reports. Owns nothing about what a sight DOES — that is
 * `sights.ts`, from `CONFIG.sights`.
 *
 * Shared by every weapon with a rail on purpose: an optic is a thing bolted to
 * one, and all four primaries have one. Duplicating these builders per weapon
 * would be three more places for the eye reference to drift, and the eye
 * reference is the number ADS derives the whole aimed pose from.
 *
 * Everything here is expressed against the weapon's own `OpticMount` — the
 * height of its rail and where along it the sight sits — so the same optic
 * lands correctly on a receiver of a different height without a single number
 * being re-tuned. That is not a convenience: `ViewModel.setSight` derives the
 * aimed pose from `sightCenter`, so a sight that ends up somewhere else is
 * still perfectly aligned, just carried differently.
 *
 * The other number everything is measured against is `eyeDistance` — how far
 * back the eye is held, which is what turns a length here into the angle the
 * shooter actually gets. It lives in `CONFIG.sights`, so an optic's size and
 * its eye relief are two halves of one decision; see `eyeDistance` below.
 *
 * Invariants: each optic is merged into its OWN meshes rather than into the
 * weapon's, which is what lets one be swapped for another without rebuilding
 * the gun under it. Emissive parts go through `build.lit`, never `collect`.
