/**
 * ViewModel.ts — The first-person weapon: whichever gun is carried and the two
 * gloved arms holding it, parented to the camera, plus every offset that moves
 * them (hip/ADS pose, sprint carry, the reload's timeline and the magazine it
 * changes, the off-hand throw's arm and give, sway, bob, kick).
 * Owns: the on-screen weapon. Nothing else may reparent or pose it.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - The magazine is the one part of a weapon that may move on its own, and it
 *   is only movable because the model merged it into a node of its own (see
 *   `WeaponParts.magazine`). Nothing else may be animated off a weapon without
 *   the same split — everything else is inside one merged mesh per colour.
 *   `stow()` is the only place that state is cleared, and every way out of a
 *   half-finished reload has to go through it or the weapon comes back without
 *   a magazine in it.
 * - The ADS pose is DERIVED, never authored: `adsPos` places the weapon so
 *   that the FITTED sight's own `sightCenter` lands on the camera's axis at
 *   that sight's `eyeRelief`. The reticle then projects to the exact centre
 *   of the screen, which is where CombatSystem sends the bullets. Hand-tuning
 *   that offset breaks the one guarantee ADS is for, and it has to be
 *   re-derived every time EITHER half of the loadout changes — a different
 *   weapon carries the same optic at a different height. `applyFit` is the
 *   only place that may write it.
 * - The aimed pose is also scaled by the sight's `zoomComp`, which is a
 *   uniform scale about the camera's origin: `adsPos` and the node's own
 *   scaling take the same factor, so no ray direction moves and the sight
 *   stays exactly on the axis. Scaling one without the other is what would
 *   break it.
 * - The FITTED optic is a request and the WORN one is the answer. A weapon
 *   with a rail wears what the kit chose; the sidearm wears the notch and
 *   blade on its own slide whatever the kit says, because it has no rail to
 *   bolt anything to. `wornSight` resolves the two and `applyFit` is the only
 *   caller, which is what keeps the aimed pose, the zoom compensation and (via
 *   `carriedSight`) the camera's own FOV all derived from one sight.
 * - A FINISH is the one thing about a weapon that may be changed after it is
 *   built, and it is a material write and nothing else: `finishes.ts` owns
 *   the table and the repaint, `WeaponParts.finish` is the set of colour
 *   groups it may reach, and the optic on the rail is deliberately not in it.
 *   Nothing downstream of the fit is re-derived for one, because a finish
 *   moves no geometry.
 * - Every weapon is built once and all but the carried one is disabled, the
 *   same trick the optics use: a loadout change is a handful of boolean
 *   writes and a re-derivation, never a rebuild. That is also why the muzzle
 *   and the ejection port are nodes owned HERE rather than the model's — they
 *   have things hanging off them (Player's flash) that must survive a swap.
 * - Everything here is cosmetic WITH ONE EXCEPTION, and it is a read rather
 *   than a write: `throwHandWorld` is where the grenade leaves from, so the
 *   throwing hand's pose is the one thing on this rig that something in the
 *   world is placed by. A grenade that spawned anywhere else is a grenade the
 *   hand did not throw, which is the whole reason the arm exists.
 * - Everything else here is cosmetic. It reads the camera; it never writes it,
 *   and it never touches aim, spread or damage.
 * - The per-shot KICK is a spring displacement Player owns and this only reads
 *   (`PoseInput.kick`), the same split as `landDip` and `bobPhase`. It goes
 *   genuinely NEGATIVE as the spring overshoots the carry on the way home, so
 *   every term reading it must invert with it — gating on `> 0` rather than
 *   `!== 0` puts a visible corner in the return. Its lateral, roll and yaw take
 *   `kickDrift` so the model leans the way the muzzle walked, and those three
 *   plus the pitch are damped by `recoil.kick.adsMult` while the z travel is
 *   not: the weapon carries the sight, so anything that rotates or laterally
 *   shifts it while aimed takes the reticle off the axis the rounds fly down.
 * - Meshes render in VIEWMODEL_GROUP with the depth buffer cleared first, so
 *   the weapon is never sliced open by the wall the player is standing
 *   against. Anything else attached to it (Player's muzzle flash) must join
 *   that group or it will be hidden behind the gun it belongs to.
 * - Arms are built at the origin and merged per colour before being parented,
 *   the same rule as BuildingKit and the weapon models: MergeMeshes bakes
 *   world matrices, so the merge is only correct at identity.
 * - The loadout screen's turntable (`beginInspect`/`updateInspect`) is the one
 *   pose that is not the carried one, and it is the only thing here that may
 *   write `rotationQuaternion`. While one is set Babylon ignores `rotation`
 *   entirely, so `endInspect` clearing it is what lets the carried pose come
 *   back at all. The turntable also owns the CARD behind the weapon — see
 *   `buildKitBackdrop`, whose whole difficulty is where in the frame it is
 *   allowed to be drawn — and it goes up and down with the pose, which is
 *   what keeps it out of every other state in the game.
