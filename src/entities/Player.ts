/**
 * Player.ts — Player controller: movement/sprint/crouch/jump physics,
 * health/regen, weapon state (fire/reload/spread), gunfeel dressing (muzzle
 * flash mesh, ejected brass), and the first-person viewmodel wiring.
 * Owns: the player Combatant, and the ViewModel hanging off the camera.
 * The carried weapon is a resolved `WeaponSetup`, never CONFIG read at the
 * use site: damage, rate, magazine, spread, range and the recoil multipliers
 * all come off it, so swapping guns is one assignment in `setWeapon`.
 * TWO weapons are carried — the kit's primary and the sidearm everyone has —
 * and each keeps its own magazine in a `Holster` while it is slung, which is
 * the whole point of the second slot: there is no reserve ammunition in this
 * game, so a swap buys you a loaded weapon in a third of a second where a
 * reload costs one and a half. `swapWeapon` starts the gesture and
 * `completeSwap` is the one place the hands change, partway through it and
 * behind the bottom of the frame. Nothing fires while it is in flight.
 * Invariants: probeGround and step-up ray tests filter metadata.solid === true.
 * `position` is the FEET, as `Combatant` requires, and is NOT `root.position`
 * — the capsule's centre, half a body higher. Anything wanting the middle of
 * the body wants `center`. The three exported points (`position`, `center`,
 * `eyePos`) are derived in `syncCombatant` and are the only ones anything
 * outside this file may read.
 * Crouch moves `eyePos` AND `center` on one blend — the eye is the camera, the
 * LOS target and the bots' aim point at once, so lowering it without lowering
 * the hit sphere makes crouching a liability rather than cover.
 * Health regenerates after CONFIG.player.regenDelay — with 8 hostile bots and
 * no medics this is load-bearing, not decoration. The player has no world body
 * mesh at all: the camera is inside the head, so the only thing on screen is
 * the viewmodel (and the blob shadow ShadowSystem draws underfoot). The flash
 * mesh and casing pool are player-only visuals (bots get neither — see
 * CONFIG.gunfeel), and the flash must join VIEWMODEL_GROUP with the rifle it
 * hangs off. Damage flows out via the onDamaged callback wired in Game.
 * The RECOIL VECTOR is built here (`recoilKick`) and nowhere else: every number
 * in it is the weapon's or the body's, and Game only wires the result to the
 * camera. The horizontal is drawn ONCE per shot into `kickDrift`, read by the
 * aim, by the viewmodel's lean and by the view punch — a second draw anywhere
 * would have the weapon leaning one way while the muzzle walked the other.
 * `stringed` is the single test both string-shaped terms share
 * (`firstShotMult` and `recoil.pattern`); splitting them hands the DMR and the
 * pistol a 20% climb discount for firing at their own rate limit.
 * The viewmodel's kick spring is stepped in CLOSED FORM, not integrated: at
 * 6 Hz semi-implicit Euler makes the peak a function of the frame rate (0.08 at
 * 30 fps against 0.78 at 120). CameraSystem.land's 2 Hz is inside where Euler
 * holds and is deliberately not the same code.
 * Footfalls are read off the CAMERA's bob phase, never a step timer of their
 * own — the sound has to land on the dip you can see — and leave here as
 * PlayerEvents rather than as a sound: this file owns no audio.
 * Grenades are a count, a cooldown and a clock here and nothing else — the
 * thrown body belongs to GrenadeSystem, which is Game's. The clock is what
 * makes the throw a gesture rather than an event: `beginThrow` starts it,
 * `throwReleaseDue` reports the frame the hand reaches full extension, and
 * only then does Game ask the pool to carry a grenade and `spendGrenade` book
 * it. The count is still debited last, for the reason it always was — the pool
 * may refuse, and a count spent on a grenade that never arrives is worse than
 * one not thrown.

   * big the map is rather than with anything on screen. `Player.floorY` exists

   * `max`'d against `terrain.surfaceAt`, since the heightfield is the one floor
   * with no box standing in for it, and `surfaceAt` rather than the `heightAt`
   * used below because what the ray hits is a clone of the floor's own VISUAL
   * vertices, which the smooth field disagrees with by centimetres on every
   * twisted quad.
   *
   * What stops it is measured too. Over the 51,000 positions the nav graph says
   * a body can stand on, the two agree on 99.8% and disagree on 116 running
   * BOTH ways: at the valley rim the analytic matches the nav graph and the ray
   * is the one that finds nothing, while along one Greyfen fence line the
   * analytic reports a surface half a metre up that the ray passes straight
   * through. That second class is the blocker, and it is a property of the
   * primitive rather than of this call site — `topFaceAtLocalZ` extrapolates a
   * box's top-face PLANE across a footprint that `halfDepth` inflates for
   * anything pitched, so a tall thin box tilted a few degrees claims ground
   * beside itself. `NavGrid` can live with that (a phantom node is a routing
   * nuisance); a ground probe cannot, because it puts the player standing on
   * air. It waits on a footprint test bounded by the box's REAL extent.
