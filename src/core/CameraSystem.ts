/**
 * CameraSystem.ts — First-person camera: aim yaw/pitch, ADS blend (FOV +
 * sensitivity), recoil, per-shot view punch, head bob.
 * Owns: the scene's active camera. The camera sits AT the player's eye — it
 * never leaves the head, so there is no occlusion pick and no pull-in. The one
 * exception is `place()`, which hands the camera to `DeathCam` when there is no
 * longer a head to sit in; that caller owns its own pull-in, because it is the
 * only thing here that ever looks at the player from outside.
 * How far ADS zooms, how much it slows the look, and how fast it gets there
 * all belong to the LOADOUT (`setLoadout`), not to CONFIG.camera — the
 * camera's own numbers are the hip-fire ones. Zoom and sensitivity are the
 * optic's alone; only the blend RATE is shared with the weapon, because how
 * fast a sight comes up is a fact about the weight in your hands as well as
 * about the glass on top of it.
 * The player's look-speed SETTINGS (`setLookScale`, one multiplier per device)
 * multiply the CONFIG rates and reach nothing else: the ADS multipliers, the
 * optic's magnification and the aim assist's bound are all expressed against
 * those rates, so scaling at the source moves all three. `stickYawRate` is the
 * one place the stick's is written out, because that getter exists for the aim
 * assist rather than for this camera.
 * Invariants: recoil decay uses true Math.exp(-rate*dt) — NOT the frame-lerp
 * idiom — because burst climb must not vary with frame rate. Recoil only
 * partly springs back (CONFIG.recoil.recoverFraction); the rest is pushed into
 * the player's aim permanently — a deliberate product decision, not a bug.
 * `addFlinch` is the ONE aim kick that is 100% springy, and must stay that
 * way: a hit is not a choice the player made, so a permanent share would
 * ratchet the view up over one exchange. It shares the spring rather than
 * owning one, so it cannot drift against the recoil sitting on top of it.
 * The view punch (FOV spike / camera shove / directed nudge), the head bob and
 * the landing absorb are pure cosmetics: they are applied only to the rendered
 * camera, never to aimPitch/aimYaw, so bullets and bots never see them. The
 * punch's angles are drawn ONCE per shot and held, not re-rolled per frame —
 * white noise at 8-13 rounds a second is a buzz, not an impact.
 * The aimed hold sway is the ONE exception, and deliberately so: it is part of
 * aimPitch/aimYaw, because the weapon hangs off this camera and a sight
 * picture that drifts while the rounds fly down an undrifted axis is a reticle
 * that lies. See CONFIG.camera.aimSway.
 * The landing absorb is a damped spring this system owns and the viewmodel
 * READS (`landDip`) — one integrator per impact, the same rule as the bob
 * phase. It and the view punch are the only two things that write the camera's
 * roll, and they do it through ONE assignment at the end of `update`: a second
 * write site is how a roll becomes whichever contributor happened to run last.
 * Must run before lighting.update()/sfx.setListener() in Game's frame order,
 * and before the shader's eye is pushed on the way into the render.
