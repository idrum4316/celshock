/**
 * Procedural sound effects via WebAudio — no audio assets.
 *
 * Three things here exist because of the jump from a twelve-enemy arena to a
 * thirty-two-bot battlefield:
 *
 * - **One cached noise buffer.** Filling a fresh `AudioBuffer` per shot meant
 *   ~1,900 `Math.random()` calls each time; with a full firefight that was
 *   hundreds of buffer allocations a second on the main thread. Now a single
 *   one-second buffer is generated on unlock and every burst plays a random
 *   slice of it.
 * - **Positional playback.** A distant firefight has to sit behind you rather
 *   than in your ear, so world-space sounds run through a `PannerNode` with
 *   distance rolloff and are dropped entirely past `maxDistance`.
 * - **A voice cap.** Sixteen bots at five rounds a second is ~80 gunshots
 *   a second. Beyond `maxVoices` concurrent one-shots, new ones are skipped —
 *   the ear cannot pick them apart anyway, and the scheduler can't keep up.
 *
 * **Gunfire is noise, not tone.** Every layer of a shot is a filtered slice of
 * the shared noise buffer; the single pitched oscillator left in a report is
 * the low chest thump, which genuinely is one frequency. An oscillator at any
 * audible pitch reads as a beep however it is enveloped, and that — more than
 * spectrum or envelope — is what made synthesized gunfire sound like a toy.
 *
 * **The tail is the reverb, not the shot.** Outdoors, a rifle is a two
 * millisecond transient followed by a quarter second of the village answering
 * it. That answer is one shared `ConvolverNode` on a send, so it costs nothing
 * per shot and, crucially, is not a voice: eighty shots a second all decay
 * through the same bus instead of eighty tail voices fighting over the cap.

  /**
   * The player's own weapon, at the player's own ear. Five layers plus the
   * shared reverb, in the order the ear resolves them: the snap of the shock
   * front, the body of the report, a low roll under it, the chest thump, and
   * the action cycling a beat later.
   *
   * **This method owns the SHAPE of a gunshot and the weapon owns nothing but
   * deviations from it** (`ReportVoice`, tabled in `CONFIG.weapons[id].report`
   * with what each field means). That split is the same one `recoilMult` makes
   * against `CONFIG.recoil`, and it is what the six guns sounding identical
   * cost: the only thing a weapon could say used to be `sfxPitch`, one
   * multiplier over every frequency, which can make a big gun a small gun
   * slowed down and nothing else. How much charge is behind the round, how
   * long the report rings, how hard it drives the village and how loud the
   * mechanism is against the shot are what actually separate an SMG from a
   * DMR, and none of them had anywhere to be said.
   *
   * **The two low layers are where "heavy" lives, and they are separate on
   * purpose.** The roll is broadband noise under a resonant lowpass — the gas
   * column, which has no pitch — and the thump is the one pitched oscillator
   * this class allows itself, because the pressure pulse genuinely is a single
   * frequency. Either alone is thin: noise without the sine is a rumble with
   * no centre, and the sine without the noise is a kick drum. The roll's raw
   * gain looks enormous beside the others and is not — a lowpass at 360 Hz
   * throws away all but about a tenth of a noise slice's amplitude, the same
   * arithmetic the body layer and every footstep in here are written against.
   *
   * **These five layers are the one sound in the game exempt from the voice
   * cap** (`keep`), and it is the impact reserve's argument taken one step
   * further. The cap is first-come-first-served, so the firefight loud enough
   * to spend it is exactly the moment the player's own weapon would come out
   * thin — the roll, the thump and the action are scheduled last and would be
   * the three dropped, which is to say the gun would lose its bottom end
   * precisely when it is being fired in anger. The exemption is bounded by
   * construction rather than by trust: ONE shooter, five layers, and a rate the
   * weapon table caps. Computed over every weapon's whole magazine held down,
   * the worst case is TEN — the carbine, whose three rounds inside 0.1 s stack
   * deeper than the LMG's nine or the rifle's seven — against a cap of 24 with
   * 6 of those already reserved from impacts. They are still COUNTED, so
   * everything else still yields to them.

  /**
   * Somebody else's weapon, somewhere out in the village. Three layers,
   * spatialised, and the first thing dropped when the voice budget runs out.
   *
   * **Distance is heard three ways here, and only one of them is volume.** The
   * panner handles the level; on top of that the report arrives late (sound
   * covers the map in a fifth of a second, and a flash you see before you hear
   * it is the strongest range cue there is), air absorption strips the top off
   * the crack long before the shot gets quiet, and the reverb send climbs, so
   * a shot across the valley is nearly all tail. The result is that a rifle at
   * 15 m and one at 60 m are different *sounds*, not the same sound twice.
   *
   * **The third layer is the low roll, and it is gated on distance rather than
   * faded out over the full range** (`CONFIG.audio.thumpRange`). It is what
   * makes a weapon going off across the street a physical event rather than a
   * noise, and it is also the layer the map cannot afford at scale: this is
   * the sound sixteen bots generate eighty a second, and the ones out at
   * sixty metres would be spending a voice on a rumble the panner has already
   * taken to nothing. So the near half of the field gets weight and the far
   * half gets range cues, which is what each one is actually listening for.
   *
   * `voice` is the shooter's weapon, and it is the whole reason a match can be
   * read by ear: sixteen bots fire one flat round off the same rig and are
   * heard as the rifle they are holding, while a person's slot carries their
   * own weapon from the authority (`ServerEvent.fire`'s `w`). A DMR two
   * streets away does not sound like the SMG beside you.
   *
   * `after` is extra seconds on the audio clock, on top of the propagation
   * delay, and it exists for one caller: a netplay round is told what a remote
   * weapon did once per snapshot, so two rounds fired inside the same 50 ms
   * arrive as one message and have to be laid back out in time. Scheduled on
   * the audio clock rather than through a `setTimeout`, so the spacing is
   * sample-accurate and unaffected by the frame rate.
