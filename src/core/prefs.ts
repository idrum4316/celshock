/**
 * prefs.ts — What the player picked last time: difficulty, map, loadout (both
 * slots and a finish per weapon) and region.
 * Owns the localStorage round trip for each; owns nothing that applies them
 * (that is `Game.setDifficulty` / `setMap` / `applyLoadout` / `setRegion`).
 * Sibling of [`settings.ts`](settings.ts), which does the same job for the
 * display settings and is separate only because those are one flat object
 * behind one screen, where these are four unrelated picks made in three places.
 * Invariants: storage throwing is NEVER fatal — private browsing and `file://`
 * both throw on the first `getItem`, and a forgotten preference is not worth
 * failing a boot over, so every reader falls back to a default.
 * Anything read back that INDEXES a table is validated rather than trusted: the
 * store holds strings the player can edit, and an id that no longer exists
 * would otherwise look up a built model with `undefined`.
