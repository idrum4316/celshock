/**
 * The scale a fresh install starts at: the rung NEAREST the resolution the game

 *
 * `1 / devicePixelRatio` is the old behaviour expressed on this ladder — the
 * backing store used to match the CSS pixel grid — so on a 1x display that is
 * 1.0 and nothing changes at all, and on a 2x display it is 0.5, which is
 * exactly the frame that shipped. The sharpness is then one keypress away
 * rather than forced on a machine that has never been measured; `FINDINGS.md`
 * §1 is the reason that distinction matters.
 *
 * **NEAREST, and it used to be "largest rung at or below", which is a bug on
 * every fractional-DPI display there is.** `1 / dpr` is only ON this ladder for
 * dpr 1, 1.333 and 2. Everywhere else, rounding down takes the rung below —
 * and the gap between rungs is a third of the resolution, so the "safe"
 * direction is not safe at all. Measured on the display that reported it:
 * **dpr 1.4406 gives `1/dpr` = 0.694, rounded DOWN to 0.5, for a hardware
 * scaling level of 1.388 — 52% of the pixel count the game drew before the
 * setting existed**, upscaled by the browser. Every hard edge in a renderer
 * with no MSAA gets chunkier and crawls: it reads as lines flickering along the
 * viewmodel, the interior walls, the stair sides and every place two surfaces
 * meet, none of which changed. Rounding to the nearest rung bounds the error at
 * half a rung either way — the same display now takes 0.75, a level of 0.926
 * and 17% MORE pixels than shipped, which is a cost the player can spend one
 * keypress undoing, where blur is not.
 *
 * The ladder still cannot express `1/dpr` exactly, and that is the honest limit
 * of a three-rung setting. A fourth rung, or letting the default sit off the
 * ladder, is what "exactly what shipped, on every machine" would take;
 * `CONFIG.graphics.renderScales` is where that decision lives.
 *
 * A display past 2x has no rung near `1/dpr` either and takes the lowest one,
 * coming out sharper than before. That is the right way for the clamp to fail
 * and it only reaches phones — unchanged by this.
