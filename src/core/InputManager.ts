/**
 * InputManager.ts — Unified keyboard/mouse + gamepad input state, plus gamepad
 * haptics (rumble()).
 * Owns: raw event listeners, the per-frame public fields (move/look/actions)
 * that Game and CameraSystem read, and the GamepadHapticsActuator pulses.
 * Invariants: update() must be called exactly once per frame — it composes
 * state and RESETS accumulators and edge-triggered flags (jumpPressed,
 * reloadPressed, confirmPressed, ads). Anything that assigned those fields
 * externally is overwritten next tick (this bites headless test scripts).
 * rumble() must stay a silent no-op when there is no pad, no actuator, or
 * the effect is rejected — haptics are a garnish, never a failure path.
 * Every key this file binds is listed in BOUND_CODES and has its browser
 * default suppressed; a new binding that is not added there will fight the
 * browser (Ctrl+letter combinations especially — crouch is Ctrl).
 * TOUCH is a third source folded in exactly as the pad is — one poll at the
 * top of update(), OR'd into the same fields — so nothing downstream knows how
 * many devices the player has. It is INJECTED (`setTouchSource`) rather than
 * imported: the layer that draws it is a screen, and core does not import
 * src/ui. The one thing that is not a fold is `touchLookX/Y`, which the camera
 * reads on its own path; see the field.
