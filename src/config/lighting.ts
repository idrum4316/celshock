   *
   * They are here because the alternative is whatever the moon and the last
   * frame's fixtures happen to be doing to a gun held at hip height in a
   * dark village — and on the one screen whose entire job is to show you the
   * weapon, that is a black silhouette. The weapon's albedo is a night

   * lamp: `col = albedo * light` in the cel shader, and a #2a-ish receiver
   * needs light well past 1 before it reads as metal rather than as a hole.
   *
   * Two of them — a warm key above the weapon and a dimmer cool fill from
   * beyond it and below — because a single light flattens the model into one
   * tone, and the hard bands the shader quantises the light into need
   * something to vary across before they read as shape.
   *
   * The short range is load-bearing: the stage is a hole in the kit screen's
   * scrim, so anything these reach is visible behind the weapon.
