/**
 * The optics the player can fit, and everything that differs between them.
 * The keys ARE the sight ids — `SightId` in `entities/sights.ts` is derived
 * from this table, so adding an optic here and a builder in `optics.ts` is
 * the whole job.
 *
 * Every sight fires the same bullets: damage, spread and recoil are the
 * rifle's, not the optic's. What an optic changes is what you can SEE and
 * how fast you can bring it to bear, which is the trade the loadout screen
 * is asking you to make.
 *
 * `magnification` is the one number the rest is derived from — the aimed
 * FOV (`2*atan(tan(fovHip/2) / magnification)`), the look sensitivity (see
 * `camera.adsLookMouse`) and the viewmodel's zoom compensation
 * (`viewmodel.adsMagReference`) all fall out of it. Holo is 1.6, which is
 * exactly the 0.62 rad the camera used before optics were a choice, so
 * fitting it reproduces the shipped weapon frame for frame.
 *
 * **Written in ascending magnification, because that order IS the loadout
 * row** — `SIGHT_IDS` is `Object.keys` of this table, and it is what the
 * buttons are drawn in and what left/right steps through. A sight inserted
 * out of order puts a 3.5x scope between two red dots.
