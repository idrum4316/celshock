/**
 * sw.js — the service worker: what makes the game launch with the phone in
 * flight mode, and what decides how soon a deploy reaches the person playing.
 * This file is a TEMPLATE: it is never served as it stands. `vite.config.ts`'s
 * `serviceWorker()` plugin reads it after a build, replaces `__PRECACHE__` with
 * the manifest of what that build actually emitted, and writes the result to
 * `dist/sw.js`.
 *
 * It is plain JavaScript, not TypeScript, because nothing imports it — it is
 * copied as text — and a `.js` file under `src/` is invisible to `tsc`. Keep
 * it small enough to read in one sitting; there is no typecheck behind it.
 *
 * **The one rule the rest of this file is an argument for: THE NAVIGATION IS
 * NETWORK-FIRST AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS CACHE-FIRST**, and the split is not a
 * compromise between two strategies — it is the shape of the build. Vite
 * content-hashes everything under `/assets/`, so those URLs are their own
 * bytes: cache-first there is not merely fast, it can never be wrong, and it is
 * where all eleven megabytes are. `index.html` is the ONE unhashed file and the
 * only thing that names which build is which, so it is the only file whose
 * cached copy can be stale — and it is eight kilobytes.
 *
 * That is the whole update mechanism. Fetch the eight kilobytes, and the asset
 * URLs in them decide the version; a hit is the build you already have, a miss
 * is the build you do not, and the cache fills itself either way.
 *
 * **This used to be cache-first for the navigation too, and the cost was not
 * the one the comment here claimed.** It said a deploy took effect "on the
 * launch after next" — one launch behind, in exchange for never waiting on the
 * network to start. In practice it was five to ten launches behind, because
 * "the launch after next" quietly assumed two things that are not true. The
 * new worker has to have NOTICED, and a reload does not make it look: a
 * `register()` call for an already-registered script returns without checking
 * and the browser's own soft update is throttled, so the check is now made by
 * hand in `register.ts` — read that note, it is half of this bug. And the new
 * worker has to have FINISHED, which meant one `cache.addAll` over the entire
 * 11 MB build, all-or-nothing, every refresh in the meantime served the old
 * shell, and a home-screen app closed mid-download starting again from zero.
 * So the number of times you had to reopen the game was really a measure of
 * how long you left it open. Freshness cannot rest on a background download
 * completing; it now rests on a request the launch itself makes.
 *
 *   install   fill this build's cache. Content-hashed URLs are COPIED from
 *             whatever cache already holds them; only what changed is fetched.
 *   activate  turn navigation preload on, and drop every other cache — a
 *             version no longer current is megabytes nobody will load again.
 *   fetch     a navigation is the network's answer, or the cached shell if the
 *             network does not answer in time. Everything else same-origin
 *             comes from the cache when it is there and fills it when it is
 *             not. Everything else again is passed through.
 *
 * `sw.js` MUST still be served no-cache (see docker/default.conf.template): the
 * navigation above keeps a launch current on its own, but a worker that can
 * never notice it is out of date is a precache that never advances, and the
 * first flight-mode launch after a deploy would be the build before it.

/**
 * How long a launch waits for a fresh shell before drawing the one it already
 * has, and — separately — how long the request itself is given before it is
 * abandoned.
 *
 * Offline the first is never reached: a fetch with nowhere to go rejects at
 * once. It is the budget for a network that is PRESENT AND NOT ANSWERING — a
 * captive portal, a dead cell, a train. Falling back costs the player the
 * previous build for one launch, which is what every launch used to cost, so
 * erring short is cheap.
 *
 * The second is a different number for a different reason. A shell that is
 * merely slow rather than dead is still worth finishing, because the worker is
 * awake for the whole page load anyway — every subresource below is going
 * through it — so a copy that arrives after the fallback was drawn still lands
 * in the cache and leaves the NEXT launch current. What must not happen is
 * holding the line open indefinitely, and that is why the shell fetch is
 * deliberately NOT wrapped in `waitUntil` and is aborted where this worker owns
 * the request. Measured against a server that accepts a connection and then
 * answers nothing at all: pinned open, every stalled launch leaks a socket, a
 * browser allows six per host, and after a handful of launches the app cannot
 * fetch anything — the shell, the bundle or the match list. A stale shell is a
 * bad launch; a starved socket pool is no launch.
