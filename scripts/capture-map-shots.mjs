/**
 * Photographs each map from the vantage `src/ui/mapShots.ts` states for it, and
 * writes the result to `shots/<id>.jpg` — the backdrop the main menu stands on.
 *
 * Run with `npm run shots`. Committed output, like `public/icons/` and the
 * water textures: the game is built from primitives at runtime and ships no
 * authored art, so the only honest way to have a picture of a map is to take
 * one of the real thing.
 *
 * **The pose is not here.** `MAP_SHOTS` in `src/ui/mapShots.ts` carries the
 * vantage beside the image it produced, so a re-frame is an edit to the table
 * the menu already reads and never to this file; what is here is only how a
 * browser is made to stand there. A map with no row in that table is not
 * photographed and is not an error — its menu falls back to the plain veil.
 *
 * **It runs in a real Chromium against the dev server** for the reason the
 * collision bake does: the point is a picture of what the CLIENT actually
 * builds, and the only way to be sure of that is to let the client build it.
 *
 * Four things have to be true of the frame before it is worth keeping, and all
 * four are arranged below rather than assumed:
 *
 * - **No interface.** A page screenshot is the whole window, not the canvas
 *   element, so the deploy screen the round drops us on would be in the shot.
 *   `#hud` is hidden outright.
 * - **No bodies and no flags.** Sixteen bots spawn with the round and the
 *   capture zones draw a ring and a beacon at every control point — the
 *   brightest thing on a night map, and annotation rather than world. Both are
 *   taken out, so what is left is the place.
 * - **The lamps are lit.** Dynamic light is uploaded by `LightingSystem` from
 *   `Game.updateGameplay`, which does not run in `deploy` — so a village that
 *   has never been played in has its windows dark. The script pushes one
 *   update itself, from the camera it just moved.
 * - **Several frames, not one.** The shadow map is stepped and the post chain
 *   has state; the first frame after a teleport is not the picture.
 *
 * A re-run is a NEW picture rather than the same bytes: the sky drifts with
 * real time and the frame is whatever the machine had rendered when the
 * screenshot was taken. Re-run it when a map or a vantage has actually moved,
 * not as housekeeping.
